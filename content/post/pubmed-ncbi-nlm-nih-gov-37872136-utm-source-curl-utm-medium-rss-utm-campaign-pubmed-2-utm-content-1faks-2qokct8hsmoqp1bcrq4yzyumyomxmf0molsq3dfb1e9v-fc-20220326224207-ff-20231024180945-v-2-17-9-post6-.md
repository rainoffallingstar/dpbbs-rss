description: Immunotherapies targeting cancer-specific neoantigens have revolutionized
  the treatment of cancer patients. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic therapies
  synergize with immunotherapies, mediated by the de-repression of endogenous retroviral
  element (ERV)-encoded promoters, and the initiation of transcription. Here, we use
  deep RNA sequencing from cancer cell lines treated with DNA methyltransferase inhibitor
  (DNMTi) and/or Histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), to assemble a de ...
