description: Enhancing nanoparticles' anti-cancer capabilities as drug carriers requires
  the careful adjustment of formulation parameters, including loading efficiency,
  drug/carrier ratio, and synthesis method. Small adjustments to these parameters
  can significantly influence the drug-loading efficiency of nanoparticles. Our study
  explored how chitosan and polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings affect the structural
  properties, drug-loading efficiency, and anti-cancer efficacy of Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles
