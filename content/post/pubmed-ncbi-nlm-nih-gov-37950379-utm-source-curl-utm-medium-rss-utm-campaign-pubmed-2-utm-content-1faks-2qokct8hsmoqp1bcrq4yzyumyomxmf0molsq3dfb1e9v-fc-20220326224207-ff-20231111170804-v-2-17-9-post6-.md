description: It is well established that P3 latencies increase with age. Investigating
  these age-related differences requires numerous methodological decisions, resulting
  in pipelines of great variation. The aim of the present work was to investigate
  the effects of different analytical pipelines on the age-related differences in
  P3 latencies in real data. Therefore, we conducted an explorative multiverse study
  and varied the low-pass filter (4 Hz, 8 Hz, 16 Hz, 32 Hz, and no filter), the latency
