description: This mini review investigates the importance of GABAergic interneurons
  for the network function of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived
  brain organoids. The presented evidence suggests that the abundance, diversity and
  three-dimensional cortical organization of GABAergic interneurons are the primary
  elements responsible for the creation of synchronous neuronal firing patterns. Without
  intricate inhibition, coupled oscillatory patterns cannot reach a sufficient complexity
