description: During recombination, the cosmic background radiation is disturbed, in
  particular, by Lyman-alpha emissions from neutral hydrogen. It is proposed to account
  for the subsequent time-dependent partial thermalization of the Ly α energy content
  in an analytically solvable nonlinear diffusion model. The amplitude of the partially
  thermalized and redshifted Ly α line is found to be too low to be visible in the
  cosmic microwave spectrum, in accordance with previous numerical models and ...
