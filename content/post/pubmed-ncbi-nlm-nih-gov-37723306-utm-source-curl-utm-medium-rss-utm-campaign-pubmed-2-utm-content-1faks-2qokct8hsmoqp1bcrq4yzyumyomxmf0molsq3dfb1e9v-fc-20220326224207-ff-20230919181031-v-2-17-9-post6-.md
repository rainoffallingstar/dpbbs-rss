  in T cells that is recurrently inactivated in T cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-NHLs).
  The highest frequencies of PDCD1 deletions are detected in advanced disease, predicting
  inferior prognosis. However, the tumor-suppressive mechanisms of PD-1 signaling
  remain unknown. Here, using tractable mouse models for T-NHL and primary patient
