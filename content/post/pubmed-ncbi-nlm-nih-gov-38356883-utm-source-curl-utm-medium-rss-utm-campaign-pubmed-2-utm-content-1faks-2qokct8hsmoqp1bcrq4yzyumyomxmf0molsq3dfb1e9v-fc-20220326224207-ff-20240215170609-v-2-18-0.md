description: Cerebral oedema following acute ischemic infarction has been correlated
  with poor functional outcomes and is the driving mechanism of malignant infarction.
  Measurements of midline shift and qualitative assessment for herniation are currently
  the main CT indicators for cerebral oedema but have limited sensitivity for small
  cortical infarcts and are typically a delayed sign. In contrast, diffusion-weighted
  (DWI) or T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are highly sensitive but ...
