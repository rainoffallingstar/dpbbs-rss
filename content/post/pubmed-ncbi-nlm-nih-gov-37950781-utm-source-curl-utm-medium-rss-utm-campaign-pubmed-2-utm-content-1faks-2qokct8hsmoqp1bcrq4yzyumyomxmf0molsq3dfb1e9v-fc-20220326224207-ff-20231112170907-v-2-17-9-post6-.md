description: Ethylene oxide (EtO) is a widely used industrial chemical with recognized
  health risks. While its carcinogenic properties have been extensively studied, emerging
  evidence suggests potential associations with cardiovascular diseases. Using the
  recently introduced Life's Essential 8 (LE8) score as a comprehensive cardiovascular
  health (CVH) measure, this study aimed to elucidate the relationship between EtO
  exposure and CVH. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
