description: Tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) are currently revolutionising
  many fields, yet their applications are often limited by the lack of suitable training
  data in programmatically accessible format. Here we propose an effective solution
  to make data scattered in various locations and formats accessible for data-driven
  and machine learning applications using the overlay databank format. To demonstrate
  the practical relevance of such approach, we present the NMRlipids ...
