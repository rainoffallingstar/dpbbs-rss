description: The emergence of spontaneous nonmalignant chylous effusions during treatment
  with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been previously described; however,
  there have been no prior reports for alectinib. Herein, we report a case of symptomatic
  bilateral chylothorax during alectinib therapy in a patient with ALK-rearranged
  lung adenocarcinoma. Although immediate control of symptoms was achieved by placement
