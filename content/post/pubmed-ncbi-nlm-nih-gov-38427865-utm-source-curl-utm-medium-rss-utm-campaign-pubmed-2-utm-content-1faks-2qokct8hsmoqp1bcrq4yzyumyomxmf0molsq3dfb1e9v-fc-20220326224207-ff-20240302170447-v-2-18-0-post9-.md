description: We study how isotropic and homogeneous far-from-equilibrium quantum systems
  relax to nonthermal attractors, which are of interest for cold atoms and nuclear
  collisions. We demonstrate that a first-order ordinary differential equation governs
  the self-similar approach to nonthermal attractors, i.e., the prescaling. We also
  show that certain natural scaling-breaking terms induce logarithmically slow corrections
  that prevent the scaling exponents from reaching the constant values during ...
