description: In situ vaccination (ISV) triggers an immune response to tumor-associated
  antigens at one tumor site that can then tackle disease throughout the body. Here
  we report clinical and biological results of a phase I/II ISV trial in patients
  with low-grade lymphoma (NCT02927964) combining an intratumoral TLR9 agonist with
  local low-dose radiation, and ibrutinib (an inhibitor of B and T cell kinases).
  Adverse events were predominately low grade. The overall response rate was 50%,
