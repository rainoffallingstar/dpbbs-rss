description: Collinear laser spectroscopy was performed on the isomer of the aluminium
  isotope ^{26m}Al. The measured isotope shift to ^{27}Al in the 3s^{2}3p ^{2}P_{3/2}^{○}→3s^{2}4s
  ^{2}S_{1/2} atomic transition enabled the first experimental determination of the
  nuclear charge radius of ^{26m}Al, resulting in R_{c}=3.130(15) fm. This differs
  by 4.5 standard deviations from the extrapolated value used to calculate the isospin-symmetry
  breaking corrections in the superallowed β decay of ^{26m}Al. ...
