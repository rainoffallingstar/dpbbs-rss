description: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by aggregation of α-synuclein
  (α-syn) into protein inclusions in degenerating brains. Increasing amounts of aggregated
  α-syn species indicate significant perturbation of cellular proteostasis. Altered
  proteostasis depends on α-syn protein levels and the impact of α-syn on other components
  of the proteostasis network. Budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as
  eukaryotic reference organism to study the consequences of α-syn expression on ...
