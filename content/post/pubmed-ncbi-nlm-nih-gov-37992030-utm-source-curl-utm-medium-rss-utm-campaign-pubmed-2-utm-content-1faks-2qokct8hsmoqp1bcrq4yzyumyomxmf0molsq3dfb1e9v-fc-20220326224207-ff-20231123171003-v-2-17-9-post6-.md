description: The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is the most widely used test for
  colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. RAID-CRC Screen is a new non-invasive test based
  on fecal bacterial markers, developed to complement FIT by increasing its specificity.
  The test was previously clinically evaluated in FIT-positive patients (>20 μg of
  hemoglobin/g of feces, "FIT20"), in which it reduced the proportion of false positive
  results by 16.3% while maintaining most of FIT20's sensitivity. The aim of this
  study was ...
