description: Single-molecule localization microscopy achieves nanometer spatial resolution
  by localizing single fluorophores separated in space and time. A major challenge
  of single-molecule localization microscopy is the long acquisition time, leading
  to low throughput, as well as to a poor temporal resolution that limits its use
  to visualize the dynamics of cellular structures in live cells. Another challenge
  is photobleaching, which reduces information density over time and limits throughput
  and ...
