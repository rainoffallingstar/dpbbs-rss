description: Multiple theories have been proposed to describe the formation of black
  hole seeds in the early Universe and to explain the emergence of very massive black
  holes observed in the first billion years after Big Bang^(1-3). Models consider
  different seeding and accretion scenarios^(4-7), which require the detection and
  characterisation of black holes in the first few hundred million years after Big
  Bang to be validated. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec
  spectrum of GN-z11, ...
