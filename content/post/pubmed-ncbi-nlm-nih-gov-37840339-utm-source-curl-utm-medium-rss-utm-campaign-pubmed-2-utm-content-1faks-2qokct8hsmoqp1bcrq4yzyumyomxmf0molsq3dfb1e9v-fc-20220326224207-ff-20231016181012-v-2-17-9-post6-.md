description: Despite molecular selection, patients (pts) with RAS wildtype mCRC represent
  a heterogeneous population including diversity in metastatic spread. We investigated
  metastatic patterns for their prognostic and predictive impact on maintenance therapy
  with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid ± panitumumab. The study population was stratified
  according to (1) number of involved metastatic sites (single vs multiple organ metastasis),
  liver-limited disease vs (2) liver metastasis plus one additional site, ...
