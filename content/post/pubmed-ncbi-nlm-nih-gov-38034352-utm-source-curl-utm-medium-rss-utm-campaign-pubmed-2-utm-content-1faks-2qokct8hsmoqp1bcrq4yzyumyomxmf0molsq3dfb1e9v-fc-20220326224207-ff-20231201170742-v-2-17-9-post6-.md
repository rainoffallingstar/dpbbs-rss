description: Peritoneal adhesions are poorly understood but highly prevalent conditions
  that can cause intestinal obstruction and pelvic pain requiring surgery. While there
  is consensus that stress-induced inflammation triggers peritoneal adhesions, the
  molecular processes of their formation still remain elusive. We performed murine
  models and analyzed human samples to monitor the formation of adhesions and the
  treatment with DNases. Various molecular analyses were used to evaluate the adhesions.
