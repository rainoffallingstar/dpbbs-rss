description: The extracellular environment regulates the structures and functions
  of cells, from the molecular to the tissue level. However, the underlying mechanisms
  influencing the organization and adaptation of cancer in 3D environments are not
  yet fully understood. In this study, we investigate the influence of the viscosity
  of the environment on the mechanical adaptability of human hepatoma cell (HepG2)
  spheroids in vitro, using 3D microcapsule reactors formed with droplet-based microfluidics.
