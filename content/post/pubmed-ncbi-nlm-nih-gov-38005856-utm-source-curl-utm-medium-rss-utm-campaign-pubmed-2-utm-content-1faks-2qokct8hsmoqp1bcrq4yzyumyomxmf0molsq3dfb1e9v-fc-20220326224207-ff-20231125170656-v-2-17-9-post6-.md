description: Viral disinfection is important for medical facilities, the food industry,
  and the veterinary field, especially in terms of controlling virus outbreaks. Therefore,
  standardized methods and activity levels are available for these areas. Usually,
  disinfectants used in these areas are characterized by their activity against test
  organisms (i.e., viruses, bacteria, and/or yeasts). This activity is usually determined
  using a suspension test in which the test organism is incubated with the ...
