description: The development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly
  advanced cancer treatment. However, their efficacy is not consistent across all
  patients, underscoring the need for personalized approaches. In this study, we examined
  the relationship between activated CD4^(+) memory T cell expression and ICI responsiveness.
  A notable correlation was observed between increased activated CD4^(+) memory T
  cell expression and better patient survival in various cohorts. Additionally, ...
