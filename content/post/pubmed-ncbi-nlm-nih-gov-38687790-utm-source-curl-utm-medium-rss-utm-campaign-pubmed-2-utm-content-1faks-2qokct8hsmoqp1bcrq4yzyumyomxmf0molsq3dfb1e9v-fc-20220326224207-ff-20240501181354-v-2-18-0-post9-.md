description: Eosinophil recruitment is a pathological hallmark of many allergic and
  helminthic diseases. Here, we investigated chemokine receptor CCR3-induced eosinophil
  recruitment in sialyltransferase St3gal4^(-/-) mice. We found a marked decrease
  in eosinophil extravasation into CCL11-stimulated cremaster muscles and into the
  inflamed peritoneal cavity of St3gal4^(-/-) mice. Ex vivo flow chamber assays uncovered
  reduced adhesion of St3gal4^(-/-) compared to wild type eosinophils. Using flow
  cytometry, ...
