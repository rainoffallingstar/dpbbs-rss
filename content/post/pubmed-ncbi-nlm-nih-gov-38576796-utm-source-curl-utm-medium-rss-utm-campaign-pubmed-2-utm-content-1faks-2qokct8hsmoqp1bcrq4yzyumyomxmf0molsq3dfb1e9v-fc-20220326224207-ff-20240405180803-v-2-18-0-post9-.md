description: Recent reports indicated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated
  disease might be a rare complication after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
  2 infection or vaccination. It is unclear whether this is an unspecific sequel of
  infection or vaccination or caused by possible immunological cross-reactivity of
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 proteins and myelin oligodendrocyte
  glycoprotein. The aim of this study was therefore to elucidate whether ...
