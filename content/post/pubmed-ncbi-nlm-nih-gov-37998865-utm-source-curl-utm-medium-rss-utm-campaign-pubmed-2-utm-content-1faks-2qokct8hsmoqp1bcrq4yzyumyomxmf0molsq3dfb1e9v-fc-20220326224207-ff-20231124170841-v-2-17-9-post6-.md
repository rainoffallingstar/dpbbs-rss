description: Nosocomial clusters of fungal infections, whilst uncommon, cannot be
  predicted and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Here, we
  review reports of nosocomial outbreaks of invasive fungal disease to glean insight
  into their epidemiology, risks for infection, methods employed in outbreak detection
  including genomic testing to confirm the outbreak, and approaches to clinical and
  infection control management. Both yeasts and filamentous fungi cause outbreaks,
