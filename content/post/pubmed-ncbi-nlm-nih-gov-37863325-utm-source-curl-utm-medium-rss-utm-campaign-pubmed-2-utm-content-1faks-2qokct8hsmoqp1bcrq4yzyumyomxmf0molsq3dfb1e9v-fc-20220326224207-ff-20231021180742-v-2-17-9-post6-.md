description: The CD40 receptor and its ligand CD154 are widely expressed in various
  immune-competent cells. Interaction of CD154 with CD40 is essential for B-cell growth,
  differentiation, and immunoglobulin class switching. Many other immune-competent
  cells involved in innate and adaptive immunity communicate through this co-stimulatory
  ligand-receptor dyad. CD40-CD154 interaction is involved in the pathogenesis of
  numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. While CD40 and CD154 are ...
