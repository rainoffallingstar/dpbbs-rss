description: Histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosing fibrosis, but its
  routine use is constrained by the need for additional stains, time, personnel and
  resources. Vibrational spectroscopy is a novel technique that offers an alternative
  atraumatic approach, with short scan times, while providing metabolic and morphological
  data. This review evaluates vibrational spectroscopy for the assessment of fibrosis,
  with a focus on point-of-care capabilities. OVID Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases
