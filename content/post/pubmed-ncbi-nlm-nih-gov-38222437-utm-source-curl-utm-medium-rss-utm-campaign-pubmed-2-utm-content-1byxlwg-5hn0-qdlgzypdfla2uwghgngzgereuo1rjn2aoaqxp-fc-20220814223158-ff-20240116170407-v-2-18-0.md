description: Data Augmentation is a crucial tool in the Machine Learning (ML) toolbox
  because it can extract novel, useful training images from an existing dataset, thereby
  improving accuracy and reducing overfitting in a Deep Neural Network (DNNs). However,
  clinical dermatology images often contain irrelevant background information,such
  as furniture and objects in the frame. DNNs make use of that information when optimizing
  the loss function. Data augmentation methods that preserve this information ...
