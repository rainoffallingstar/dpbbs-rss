description: Factor analysis decomposes single-cell gene expression data into a minimal
  set of gene programs that correspond to processes executed by cells in a sample.
  However, matrix factorization methods are prone to technical artifacts and poor
  factor interpretability. We address these concerns with Spectra, an algorithm that
  combines user-provided gene programs with the detection of novel programs that together
  best explain expression covariation. Spectra incorporates existing gene sets and
