description: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid reduction in renal
  function and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The broadly used anti-cancer chemotherapeutic
  agent cisplatin often induces AKI as an adverse drug side effect. Therapies targeted
  at the reversal of AKI and its potential progression to chronic kidney disease or
