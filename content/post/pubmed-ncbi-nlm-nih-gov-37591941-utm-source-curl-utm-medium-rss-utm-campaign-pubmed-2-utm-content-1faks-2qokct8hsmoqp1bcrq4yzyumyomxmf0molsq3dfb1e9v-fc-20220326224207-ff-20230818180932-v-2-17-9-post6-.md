description: To characterize the genomic landscape and leukemogenic pathways of older,
  newly diagnosed, non-intensively treated patients with AML and to study the clinical
  implications, comprehensive genetics analyses were performed including targeted
  DNA sequencing of 263 genes in 604 patients treated in a prospective Phase III clinical
  trial. Leukemic trajectories were delineated using oncogenetic tree modeling and
  hierarchical clustering, and prognostic groups were derived from multivariable ...
