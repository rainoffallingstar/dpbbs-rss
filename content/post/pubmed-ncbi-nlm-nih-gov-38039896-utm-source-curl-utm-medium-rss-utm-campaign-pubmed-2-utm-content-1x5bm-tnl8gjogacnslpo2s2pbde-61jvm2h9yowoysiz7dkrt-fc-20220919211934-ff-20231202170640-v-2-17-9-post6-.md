  heterogeneity among individuals. In the era of precision medicine, understanding
  the genetic basis of these individual differences is crucial for developing new
  drugs and achieving personalized treatment. Despite the increasing abundance of
  cancer genomics data, predicting the relationship between cancer samples and drug
  sensitivity remains challenging. In this study, we developed an explainable graph
