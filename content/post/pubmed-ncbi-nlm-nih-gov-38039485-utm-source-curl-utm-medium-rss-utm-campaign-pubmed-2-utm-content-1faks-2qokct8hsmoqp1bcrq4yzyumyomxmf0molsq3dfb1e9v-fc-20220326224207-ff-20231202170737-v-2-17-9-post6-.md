description: The changes in mean-squared charge radii of neutron-deficient gold nuclei
  have been determined using the in-source, resonance-ionization laser spectroscopy
  technique, at the ISOLDE facility (CERN). From these new data, nuclear deformations
  are inferred, revealing a competition between deformed and spherical configurations.
  The isotopes ^{180,181,182}Au are observed to possess well-deformed ground states
  and, when moving to lighter masses, a sudden transition to near-spherical shapes
  is seen ...
