description: Tension and force propagation play a central role in tissue morphogenesis,
  as they enable sub- and supra-cellular shape changes required for the generation
  of new structures. Force is often generated by the cytoskeleton, which forms complex
  meshworks that reach cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix junctions to induce
  cellular rearrangements. These mechanical properties can be measured through laser
  microdissection, which concentrates energy in the tissue of interest, disrupting
