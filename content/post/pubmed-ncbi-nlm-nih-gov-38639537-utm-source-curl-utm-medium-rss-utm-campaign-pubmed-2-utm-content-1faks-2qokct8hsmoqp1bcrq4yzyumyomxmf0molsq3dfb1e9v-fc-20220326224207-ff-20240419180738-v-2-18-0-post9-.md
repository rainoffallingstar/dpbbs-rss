description: Control over specific interfaces in devices represents a key challenge
  for modern organic electronics and photovoltaics. Such control is frequently gained
  by the use of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), which, by selection of a proper
  anchoring group, are generally discriminative with respect to different materials
  but are not selective between different areas of the same material. In particular,
  selective tailoring of the work function may be useful for different functional
  devices in ...
