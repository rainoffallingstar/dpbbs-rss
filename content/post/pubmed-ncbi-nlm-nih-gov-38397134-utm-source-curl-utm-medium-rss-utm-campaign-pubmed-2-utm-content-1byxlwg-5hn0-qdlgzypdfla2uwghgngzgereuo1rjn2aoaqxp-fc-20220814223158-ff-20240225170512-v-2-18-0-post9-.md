  in cancer genomics. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a DNA binding protein, exhibits
  specific binding patterns in the genome of cancer cells and has a non-canonical
  function to facilitate oncogenic transcription programs by cooperating with transcription
  factors bound at flanking distal regions. Identification of DNA sequence features
