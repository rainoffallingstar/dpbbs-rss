description: Broad-spectrum anti-infective chemotherapy agents with activity against
  Trypanosomes, Leishmania, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis species were identified
  from a high-throughput phenotypic screening program of the 456 compounds belonging
  to the Ty-Box, an in-house industry database. Compound characterization using machine
  learning approaches enabled the identification and synthesis of 44 compounds with
  broad-spectrum antiparasitic activity and minimal toxicity against Trypanosoma ...
