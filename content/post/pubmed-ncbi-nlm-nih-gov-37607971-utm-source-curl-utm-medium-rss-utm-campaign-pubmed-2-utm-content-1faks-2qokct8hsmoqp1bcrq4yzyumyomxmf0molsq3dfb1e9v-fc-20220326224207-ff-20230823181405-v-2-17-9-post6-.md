description: 'Cancer immunotherapy using T cell receptor-engineered T cells (TCR-Ts)
  represents a promising treatment option. However, technologies for pre-clinical
  safety assessment are incomplete or inaccessible to most laboratories. Here, TCR-T
  off-target reactivity was assessed in five steps: (1) Mapping target amino acids
  necessary for TCR-T recognition, followed by (2) a computational search for, and
  (3) reactivity screening against, candidate cross-reactive peptides in the human
  proteome. ...'
