description: The acute phase protein Serum Amyloid A (SAA) is synthesised by the liver
  in response to inflammatory stimuli. Previous studies have revealed that SAA may
  be a better biomarker of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared
  to C-reactive protein (CRP). This retrospective monocentric study evaluated whether
  SAA correlates with biomarkers like faecal calprotectin (FC), CRP, the Neutrophil
  to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet count and clinical disease activity of IBD
