description: Isolated many-body systems far from equilibrium may exhibit scaling dynamics
  with universal exponents indicating the proximity of the time evolution to a nonthermal
  fixed point. We find universal dynamics connected with the occurrence of extreme
  wave excitations in the mutually coupled magnetic components of a spinor gas which
  propagate in an effectively random potential. The frequency of these rogue waves
  is affected by the time-varying spatial correlation length of the potential, giving
