description: The synthesis of pyridines from dinitrogen in homogeneous solution is
  known to be challenging considering that an N(2) cleavage step needs to be combined
  with two N-C coupling steps. Herein, a tungsten complex bearing a tailor-made 2,2'-(^(t)Bu(2)As)(2)-substituted
  tolane ligand scaffold was shown to split N(2) to afford the corresponding tungsten
  nitride, which is not the case for the corresponding (^(i)Pr(2)As)(2)-substituted
  derivative. The former nitride was then reacted ...
