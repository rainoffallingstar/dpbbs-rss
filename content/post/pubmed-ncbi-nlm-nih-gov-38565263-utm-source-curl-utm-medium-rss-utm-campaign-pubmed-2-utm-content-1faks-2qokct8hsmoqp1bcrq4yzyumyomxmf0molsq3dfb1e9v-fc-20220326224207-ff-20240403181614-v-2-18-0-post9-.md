description: Meningioangiomatosis (MAM) remains a poorly understood lesion responsible
  for epileptic disease. In the past, MAM was primarily described in the context of
  neurofibromatosis type 2 before being mainly reported sporadically. Moreover, the
  malformative or tumoral nature is still debated. Because a subset of MAM are associated
  with meningiomas, some authors argue that MAM corresponds to an infiltration pattern
  of these tumors. For these reasons, MAM has not been added to the World ...
