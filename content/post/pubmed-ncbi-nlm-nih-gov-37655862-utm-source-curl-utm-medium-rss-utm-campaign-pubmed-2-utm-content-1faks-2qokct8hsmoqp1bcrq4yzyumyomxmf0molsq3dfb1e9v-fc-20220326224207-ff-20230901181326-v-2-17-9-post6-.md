description: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the preferred
  treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis at increased risk for
  surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and for older patients irrespective of
  risk. However, in younger, low-risk patients for whom both therapeutic options,
  TAVI and SAVR, are applicable, the optimal treatment strategy remains controversial,
  as data on long-term outcomes remain limited. The DEDICATE-DZHK6 Trial is an investigator-initiated,...
