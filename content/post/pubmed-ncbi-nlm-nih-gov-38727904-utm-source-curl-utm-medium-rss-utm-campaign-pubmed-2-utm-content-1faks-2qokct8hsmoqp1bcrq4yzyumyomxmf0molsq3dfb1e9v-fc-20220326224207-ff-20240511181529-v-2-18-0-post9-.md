description: The analysis of rare NMDAR gene variants in mice, coupled with a fundamental
  understanding of NMDAR function, plays a crucial role in achieving therapeutic success
  when addressing NMDAR dysfunctions in human patients. For the generation of such
  NMDAR mouse models, a basic knowledge of receptor structure, along with skills in
  database sequence analysis, cloning in E. coli, genetic manipulation of embryonic
  stem (ES) cells, and ultimately the genetic modification of mouse embryos, is ...
