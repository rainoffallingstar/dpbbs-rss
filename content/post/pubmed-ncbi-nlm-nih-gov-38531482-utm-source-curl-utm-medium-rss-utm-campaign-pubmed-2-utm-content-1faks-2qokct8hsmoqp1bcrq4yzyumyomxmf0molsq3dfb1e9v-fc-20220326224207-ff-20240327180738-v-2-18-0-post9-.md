description: The cytosolic dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase 9 (DPP9) cleaves protein N-termini
  post-proline or -alanine. Our analysis of DPP9 mRNA expression from the TCGA 'breast
  cancer' data set revealed that low/intermediate DPP9 levels are associated with
  poor overall survival of breast cancer patients. To unravel the impact of DPP9 on
  breast cancer development and progression, the transgenic MMTV-PyMT mouse model
  of metastasizing breast cancer was used. In addition, tissue- and time-controlled
  genetic ...
