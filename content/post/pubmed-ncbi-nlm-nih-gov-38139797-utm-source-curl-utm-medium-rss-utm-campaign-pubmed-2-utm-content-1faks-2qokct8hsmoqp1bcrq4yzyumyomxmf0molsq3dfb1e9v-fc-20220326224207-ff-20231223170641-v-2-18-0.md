description: This paper reports on the development of stable tumor-specific gold nanoparticles
  (AuNPs) activated by neutron irradiation as a therapeutic option for the treatment
  of cancer with high tumor angiogenesis. The AuNPs were designed with different mono-
  or dithiol-ligands and decorated with different amounts of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides
  as a tumor-targeting vector for α(v)β(3) integrin, which is overexpressed in tissues
  with high tumor angiogenesis. The AuNPs were evaluated for avidity in vitro ...
