description: In addition to presenting significant diagnostic and treatment challenges,
  lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common form of lung cancer. Using scRNA-Seq
  and bulk RNA-Seq data, we identify three genes referred to as HMR, FAM83A, and KRT6A
  these genes are related to necroptotic anoikis-related gene expression. Initial
  validation, conducted on the GSE50081 dataset, demonstrated the model's ability
