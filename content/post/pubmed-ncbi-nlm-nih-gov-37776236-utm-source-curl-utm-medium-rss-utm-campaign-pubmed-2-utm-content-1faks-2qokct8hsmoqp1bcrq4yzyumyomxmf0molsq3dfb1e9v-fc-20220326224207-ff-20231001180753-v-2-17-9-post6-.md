description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the cobblestone mutant to represent
  one of the very few mouse models that display both correct endodermal dorsoventral
  specification but defective compartmentalization of the proximal foregut. It stands
  exemplary for a tracheoesophageal ciliopathy, offering the possibility to elucidate
  the molecular mechanisms how primary cilia orchestrate the septation process. The
  plethora of malformations observed in the cobblestone embryo allow for a deeper
