description: Complement signaling is thought to serve as an opsonization signal to
  promote the phagocytosis of synapses by microglia. However, while its role in synaptic
  remodeling has been demonstrated in the retino-thalamic system, it remains unclear
  whether complement signaling mediates synaptic pruning in the brain more generally.
  Here we found that mice lacking the Complement receptor 3, the major microglia complement
  receptor, failed to show a deficit in either synaptic pruning or axon elimination
