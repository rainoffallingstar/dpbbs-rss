description: In the battle of the host against lentiviral pathogenesis, the immune
  response is crucial. However, several questions remain unanswered about the interaction
  with different viruses and their influence on disease progression. The simian immunodeficiency
  virus (SIV) infecting nonhuman primates (NHP) is widely used as a model for the
  study of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) both because they are evolutionarily
  linked and because they share physiological and anatomical similarities that ...
