description: 'CONCLUSION: Taken together, we report for the first time the molecular
  mechanism behind the cytotoxic effect of dioncophylline A on leukemia cells. Dioncophylline
  A showed strong cytotoxic activity, inhibited NF-κB translocation, significantly
  affected the NF-κB in silico and in vitro, subdued tube formation, induced autophagy,
  and exerted antitumor activity in vivo. Our findings enlighten both the cellular
  functions including the NF-κB signaling pathway and the cytotoxic mechanism affected
