description: NAD is a coenzyme central to metabolism that also serves as a 5'-terminal
  cap for bacterial and eukaryotic transcripts. Thermal degradation of NAD can generate
  nicotinamide and ADP-ribose (ADPR). Here, we use LC-MS/MS and NAD captureSeq to
  detect and identify NAD-RNAs in the thermophilic model archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius
  and in the halophilic mesophile Haloferax volcanii. None of the four Nudix proteins
  of S. acidocaldarius catalyze NAD-RNA decapping in vitro, but one of the ...
