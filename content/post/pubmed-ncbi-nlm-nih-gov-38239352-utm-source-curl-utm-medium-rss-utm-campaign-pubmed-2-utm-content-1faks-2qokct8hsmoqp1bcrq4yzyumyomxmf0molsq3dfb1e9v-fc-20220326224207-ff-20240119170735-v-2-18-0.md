description: Peptide-loaded MHC class I (pMHC-I) multimers have revolutionized our
  capabilities to monitor disease-associated T cell responses with high sensitivity
  and specificity. To improve the discovery of T cell receptors (TCR) targeting neoantigens
  of individual tumor patients with recombinant MHC molecules, we developed a peptide-loadable
  MHC class I platform termed MediMer. MediMers are based on soluble disulfide-stabilized
  β(2)-microglobulin/heavy chain ectodomain single-chain dimers (dsSCD) ...
