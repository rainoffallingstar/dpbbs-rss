description: Cancer cells adapt and survive through the acquisition and selection
  of molecular modifications. This process defines cancer evolution. Building on a
  theoretical framework based on heritable genetic changes has provided insights into
  the mechanisms supporting cancer evolution. However, cancer hallmarks also emerge
  via heritable nongenetic mechanisms, including epigenetic and chromatin topological
  changes, and interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Recent
