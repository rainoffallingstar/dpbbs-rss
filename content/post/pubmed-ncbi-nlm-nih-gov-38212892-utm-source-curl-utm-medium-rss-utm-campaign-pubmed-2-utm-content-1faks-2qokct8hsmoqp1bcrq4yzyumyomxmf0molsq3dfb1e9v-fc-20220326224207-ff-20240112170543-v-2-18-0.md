description: Distinguishing primary liver cancer (PLC), namely hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), from liver metastases is of crucial
  clinical importance. Histopathology remains the gold standard, but differential
  diagnosis may be challenging. While absent in most epithelial, the expression of
  the adherens junction glycoprotein N-cadherin is commonly restricted to neural and
  mesenchymal cells, or carcinoma cells that undergo the phenomenon of epithelial-to-mesenchymal...
