description: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a serious public health problem
  due to its high incidence and metastatic potential. It may progress from actinic
  keratosis (AK), a precancerous lesion, or the in situ carcinoma, Bowen's disease
  (BD). During this progression, malignant keratinocytes activate dermal fibroblasts
  into tumor promoting cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), whose origin and emergence
  remain largely unknown. Here, we generate and analyze >115,000 single-cell ...
