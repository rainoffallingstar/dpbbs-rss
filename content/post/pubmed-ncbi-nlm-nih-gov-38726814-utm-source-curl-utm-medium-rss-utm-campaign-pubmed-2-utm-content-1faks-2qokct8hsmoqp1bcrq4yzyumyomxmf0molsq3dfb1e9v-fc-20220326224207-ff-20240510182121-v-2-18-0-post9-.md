description: Electron microscopy (EM), in its various flavors, has significantly contributed
  to our understanding of lipid droplets (LD) as central organelles in cellular metabolism.
  For example, EM has illuminated that LDs, in contrast to all other cellular organelles,
  are uniquely enclosed by a single phospholipid monolayer, revealed the architecture
  of LD contact sites with different organelles, and provided near-atomic resolution
  maps of key enzymes that regulate neutral lipid biosynthesis and ...
