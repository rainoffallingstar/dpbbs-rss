description: Infants born to mothers with phenylketonuria (PKU) may develop congenital
  abnormalities because of elevated phenylalanine (Phe) levels in the mother during
  pregnancy. Maintenance of blood Phe levels between 120 and 360 μmol/L reduces risks
  of birth defects. Sapropterin dihydrochloride helps maintain blood Phe control,
  but there is limited evidence on its risk-benefit ratio when used during pregnancy.
