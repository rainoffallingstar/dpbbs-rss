description: Spalt-like proteins are Zinc finger transcription factors from Caenorhabditis
  elegans to vertebrates, with critical roles in development. In vertebrates, four
  paralogues have been identified (SALL1-4), and SALL2 is the family's most dissimilar
  member. SALL2 is required during brain and eye development. It is downregulated
  in cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor, promoting cell cycle arrest and cell death.
  Despite its critical functions, information about SALL2 regulation is scarce. Public
