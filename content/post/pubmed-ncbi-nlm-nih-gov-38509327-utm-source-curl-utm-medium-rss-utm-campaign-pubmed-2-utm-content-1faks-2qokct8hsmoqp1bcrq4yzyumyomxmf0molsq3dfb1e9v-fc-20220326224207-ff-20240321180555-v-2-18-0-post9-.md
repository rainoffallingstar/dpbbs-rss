description: Spatially resolved omics technologies are transforming our understanding
  of biological tissues. However, the handling of uni- and multimodal spatial omics
  datasets remains a challenge owing to large data volumes, heterogeneity of data
  types and the lack of flexible, spatially aware data structures. Here we introduce
  SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multiplatform
  file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations and
  alignment to ...
