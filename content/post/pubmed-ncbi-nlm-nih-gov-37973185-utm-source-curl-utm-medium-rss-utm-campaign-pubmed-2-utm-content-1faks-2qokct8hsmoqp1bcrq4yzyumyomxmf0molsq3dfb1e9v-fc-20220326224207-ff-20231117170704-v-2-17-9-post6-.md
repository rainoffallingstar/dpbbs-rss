description: 'The fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is highly expressed on carcinoma-associated
  fibroblasts in the stroma of pancreatic cancer and thus is a promising target for
  imaging and therapy. Preliminary data on PET imaging with radiolabeled FAP inhibitors
  (FAPIs) demonstrate superior tumor detection. Here we assess the accuracy of FAP-directed
  PET in patients with pancreatic cancer. Methods: Of 64 patients with suspected or
