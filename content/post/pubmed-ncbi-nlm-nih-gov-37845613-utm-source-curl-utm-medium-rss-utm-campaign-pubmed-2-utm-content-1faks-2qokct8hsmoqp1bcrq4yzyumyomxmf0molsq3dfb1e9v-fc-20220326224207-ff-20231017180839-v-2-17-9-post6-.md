description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The GEDI contains 13 items suitable to assess SR, either
  as part of regular EDI developmental monitoring or as a valid stand-alone scale.
  This short 13-item (G)EDI-SR scale may allow early detection of children with SR
  difficulties in the kindergarten setting in future and could be the basis for public
  health intervention planning. To attain this goal, future research should establish
  appropriate reference values using a representative standardization ...'
