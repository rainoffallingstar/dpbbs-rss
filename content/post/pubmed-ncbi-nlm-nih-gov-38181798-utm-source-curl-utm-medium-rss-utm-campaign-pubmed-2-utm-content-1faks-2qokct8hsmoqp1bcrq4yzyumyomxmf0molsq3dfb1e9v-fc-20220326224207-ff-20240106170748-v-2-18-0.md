description: Despite the remarkable success of anti-cancer immunotherapy, its effectiveness
  remains confined to a subset of patients-emphasizing the importance of predictive
  biomarkers in clinical decision-making and further mechanistic understanding of
  treatment response. Current biomarkers, however, lack the power required to accurately
  stratify patients. Here, we identify interferon-stimulated, Ly6E^(hi) neutrophils
  as a blood-borne biomarker of anti-PD1 response in mice at baseline. Ly6E^(hi) ...
