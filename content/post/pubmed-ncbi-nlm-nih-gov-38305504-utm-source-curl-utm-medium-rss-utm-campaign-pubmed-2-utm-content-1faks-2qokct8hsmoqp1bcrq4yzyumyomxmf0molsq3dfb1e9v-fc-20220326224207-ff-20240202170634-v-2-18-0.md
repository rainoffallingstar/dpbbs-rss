description: Understanding the dynamics of excited states after optical excitation
  at donor-acceptor (D/A) interfaces is of paramount importance for improving the
  efficiency and performance of optoelectronic devices. Here, we studied the ultrafast
  excited state dynamics after optical excitation at interfaces between the electron
  donor (D) pentacene (PEN) and the electron acceptor (A) perfuoropentacene (PFP)
  as well as within the single compounds (PEN and PFP) using femtosecond time-resolved
  second ...
