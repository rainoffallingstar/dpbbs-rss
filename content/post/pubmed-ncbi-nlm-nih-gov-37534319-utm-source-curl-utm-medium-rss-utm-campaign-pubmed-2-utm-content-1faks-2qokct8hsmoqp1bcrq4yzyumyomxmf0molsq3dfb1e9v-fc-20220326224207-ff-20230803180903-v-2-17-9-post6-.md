description: 'CONCLUSION: QCT parameters showed a significant increase of emphysema
  from GOLD 0-4 COPD. Airway changes showed a different spatial pattern with higher
  values of relative wall thickness in the lower lobes until GOLD 2 and subsequent
  lower values in GOLD3/4, whereas there were no significant differences in the upper
  lobes. Both, EI and WP(5-8) are independently correlated with lung function ...'
