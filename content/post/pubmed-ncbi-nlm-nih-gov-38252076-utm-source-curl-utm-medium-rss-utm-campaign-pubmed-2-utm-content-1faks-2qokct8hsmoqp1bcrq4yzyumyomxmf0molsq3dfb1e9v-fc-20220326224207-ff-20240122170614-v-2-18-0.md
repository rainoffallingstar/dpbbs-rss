description: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a specific class of hybrid, crystalline,
  nano-porous materials made of metal-ion-based 'nodes' and organic linkers. Most
  of the studies on MOFs largely focused on porosity, chemical and structural diversity,
  gas sorption, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis, and separation applications. In
  contrast, much less reports paid attention to understanding and tuning the electrical
  properties of MOFs. Poor electrical conductivity of MOFs (~10-7 - 10-10 Scm-1),
