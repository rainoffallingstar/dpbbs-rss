description: Placing the origin of an undeciphered script in time is crucial to understanding
  the invention of writing in human history. Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island,
  developed a script, now engraved on fewer than 30 wooden objects, which is still
  undeciphered. Its origins are also obscure. Central to this issue is whether the
  script was invented before European travelers reached the island in the eighteenth
  century AD. Hence direct radiocarbon dating of the wood plays a fundamental role.
