description: Motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive
  neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure, where death is usually secondary
  to progressive respiratory failure. Assisting people with ALS through their disease
  journey is complex and supported by clinics that provide comprehensive multidisciplinary
  care (MDC). This review aims to apply both a respiratory and a complexity lens to
  the key roles and areas of practice within the MDC model in ALS. Models of ...
