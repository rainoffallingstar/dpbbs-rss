description: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) encompasses a diverse spectrum
  of aggressive B-cell lymphomas with remarkable genetic heterogeneity and myriad
  clinical presentations. Multiplatform genomic analyses of DLBCL have identified
  oncogenic drivers within genetic subtypes that allow for pathologic subclassification
  of tumors into discrete entities with shared immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical
  features. Robust classification of lymphoid tumors establishes a foundation for
