description: The current German newborn screening (NBS) panel includes 13 inherited
  metabolic diseases (IMDs). In addition, a NBS pilot study in Southwest Germany identifies
  individuals with propionic acidemia (PA), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), combined
  and isolated remethylation disorders (e.g., cobalamin [cbl] C and methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase [MTHFR] deficiency), cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency, and neonatal
  cbl deficiency through one multiple-tier algorithm. The long-term ...
