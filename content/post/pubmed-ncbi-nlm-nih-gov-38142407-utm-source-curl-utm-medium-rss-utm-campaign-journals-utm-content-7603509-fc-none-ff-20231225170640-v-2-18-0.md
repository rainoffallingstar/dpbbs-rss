description: There is significant ongoing debate regarding type 1 VWD defintion. Previous
  guidelines recommended patients with VWF levels < 30 IU/dL be diagnosed type 1 VWD,
  whereas patients with significant bleeding and VWF levels 30-50 IU/dL be diagnosed
  with Low VWF. To elucidate the relationship between type 1 VWD and Low VWF in the
  context of age-induced increases in VWF levels, we combined datasets from two national
  cohort studies - 162 patients with Low VWF from the Low VWF in Ireland Cohort ...
