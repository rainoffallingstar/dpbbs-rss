CONCLUSIONS: Neuroimaging studies are critical in TDM-guided therapy for certain antidepressants, whereas for bupropion and MAO inhibitors, the available evidence offers no further insight. Evidence for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors is strong and justifies a titration toward suggested ranges.
