description: Recent large-scale multi-omics studies suggest that genetic factors influence
  the chemical individuality of donated blood. To examine this concept, we performed
  metabolomics analyses of 643 blood units from volunteers who donated units of packed
  red blood cells (RBCs) on two separate occasions. These analyses identified carnitine
  metabolism as the most reproducible pathway across multiple donations from the same
  donor. We also measured L-carnitine and acyl-carnitines in 13,091 packed RBC ...
