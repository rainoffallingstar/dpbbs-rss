description: Due to global climate cooling and aridification since the Paleogene,
  members of the Neogene flora were extirpated from the Northern Hemisphere or were
  confined to a few refugial areas. For some species, the final reduction/extinction
  came in the Pleistocene, but some others have survived climatic transformations
  up to the present. This has occurred in Castanea sativa, a species of high commercial
  value in Europe and a significant component of the Caucasian forests' biodiversity.
