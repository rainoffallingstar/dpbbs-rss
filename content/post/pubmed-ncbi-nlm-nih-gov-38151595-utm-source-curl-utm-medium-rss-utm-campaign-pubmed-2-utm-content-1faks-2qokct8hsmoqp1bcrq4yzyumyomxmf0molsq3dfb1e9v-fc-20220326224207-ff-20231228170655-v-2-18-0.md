description: Multiplexed fluorescence imaging is typically limited to three- to five-plex
  on standard setups. Sequential imaging methods based on iterative labeling and imaging
  enable practical higher multiplexing, but generally require a complex fluidic setup
  with several rounds of slow buffer exchange (tens of minutes to an hour for each
  exchange step). We report the thermal-plex method, which removes complex and slow
  buffer exchange steps and provides fluidic-free, rapid sequential imaging. ...
