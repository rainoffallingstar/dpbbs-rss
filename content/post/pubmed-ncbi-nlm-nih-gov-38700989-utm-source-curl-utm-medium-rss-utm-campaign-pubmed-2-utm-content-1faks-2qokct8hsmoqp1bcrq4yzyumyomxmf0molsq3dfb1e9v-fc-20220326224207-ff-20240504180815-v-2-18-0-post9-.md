description: We comment on the recently published study 'Modeling for predicting survival
  fraction of cells after ultra-high dose rate irradiation' by Shiraishiet al. While
  the general approach of the study may be appropriate, we wish to comment on its
  limitations and point out issues concerning their choice of the benchmarking and
  fitting data. The approach by the authors could become viable in an extended form
  once more comprehensive data is ...
