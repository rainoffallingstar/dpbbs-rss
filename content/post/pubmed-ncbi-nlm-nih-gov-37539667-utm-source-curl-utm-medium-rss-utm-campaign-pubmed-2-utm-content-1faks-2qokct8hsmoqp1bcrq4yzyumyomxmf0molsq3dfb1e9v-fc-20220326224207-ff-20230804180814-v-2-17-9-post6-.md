description: We conducted the first large genome-wide association study to identify
  novel genetic variants that predict better (or poorer) prognosis in colorectal cancer
  patients receiving standard first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy vs chemotherapy
  without oxaliplatin. We used data from two phase III trials, NCCTG N0147 and NCCTG
  N9741 and a population-based patient cohort, DACHS. Multivariable Cox proportional
  hazards models were employed, including an interaction term between each SNP and
