description: Autophagy-related protein 18 (Atg18) participates in the elongation of
  early autophagosomal structures in concert with Atg2 and Atg9 complexes. How Atg18
  contributes to the structural coordination of Atg2 and Atg9 at the isolation membrane
  remains to be understood. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structures of Atg18 organized
  in helical tubes, Atg18 oligomers in solution as well as on lipid membrane scaffolds.
  The helical assembly is composed of Atg18 tetramers forming a lozenge ...
