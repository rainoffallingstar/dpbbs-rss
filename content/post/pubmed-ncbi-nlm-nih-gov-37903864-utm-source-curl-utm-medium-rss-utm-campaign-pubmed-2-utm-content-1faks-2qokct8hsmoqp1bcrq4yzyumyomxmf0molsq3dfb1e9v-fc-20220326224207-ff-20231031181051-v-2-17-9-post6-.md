description: Lung fibrosis (LF) is a chronic progressive, incurable, and debilitating
  condition of the lung, which is associated with different lung disease. Treatment
  options are still sparse. Nintedanib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly
  slows the LF progression. However, there is a strong need of further research and

  that combines X-ray based lung function (XLF) with microCT and whole body plethysmography
