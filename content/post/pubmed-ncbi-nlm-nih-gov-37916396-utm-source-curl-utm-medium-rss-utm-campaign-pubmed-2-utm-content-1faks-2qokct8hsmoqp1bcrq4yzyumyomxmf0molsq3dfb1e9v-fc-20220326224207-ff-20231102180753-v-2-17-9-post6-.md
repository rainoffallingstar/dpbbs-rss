description: Burkitt lymphoma cells (BL) exploit antigen-independent tonic signals
  transduced by the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) for their survival, but the molecular
  details of the rewired BLspecific BCR signal network remain unclear. A loss of function
  screen revealed the SH2 domain-containing 5`-inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) as a
  potential modulator of BL fitness. We characterized the role of SHIP2 in BL survival
