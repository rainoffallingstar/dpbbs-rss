description: Platelets are stored at room temperature for 5-7 days (RSP). Due to frequent
  and severe shortages, the FDA recently approved up to 14-day cold-stored platelets
  in plasma (CSP). However, the post-transfusion function of CSP is unknown and it
  is unclear which donors are best suited to provide either RSP or CSP. In this study,
  we sought to evaluate the post-transfusion platelet function and its predictors
  for platelets stored for the maximum approved storage times (7-day RSP, 14-day CSP)
