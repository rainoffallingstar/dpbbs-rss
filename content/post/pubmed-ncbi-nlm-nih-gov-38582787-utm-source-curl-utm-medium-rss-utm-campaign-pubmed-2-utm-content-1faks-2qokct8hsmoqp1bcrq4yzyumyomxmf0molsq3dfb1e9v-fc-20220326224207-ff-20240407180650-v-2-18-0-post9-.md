description: In recent studies, we have established the unique adapter chimeric antigen
  receptor (CAR) platform RevCAR which uses, as an extracellular CAR domain, a peptide
  epitope instead of an antibody domain. RevCAR adapters (termed RevCAR target modules,
  RevTMs) are bispecific antibodies that enable the reversible ON/OFF switch of the
  RevCAR system, improving the safety compared to conventional CARs. Here, we describe
  for the first time its use for retargeting of both T and NK-92 cells. In addition,
