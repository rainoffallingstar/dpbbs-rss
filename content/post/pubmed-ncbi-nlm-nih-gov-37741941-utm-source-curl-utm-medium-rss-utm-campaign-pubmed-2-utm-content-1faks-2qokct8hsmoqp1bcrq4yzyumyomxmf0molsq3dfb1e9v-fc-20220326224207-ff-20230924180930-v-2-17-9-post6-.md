description: Astrocytoma and glioblastoma (GB) are reclassified subtypes of adult
  diffuse gliomas based on distinct isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation in the
  fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System.
  The recurrence of gliomas is a common and inevitable challenge, and analyzing the
  distinct genomic alterations in astrocytoma and GB could provide insights into their
  progression. This study conducted a longitudinal investigation, utilizing whole-exome
  sequencing, ...
