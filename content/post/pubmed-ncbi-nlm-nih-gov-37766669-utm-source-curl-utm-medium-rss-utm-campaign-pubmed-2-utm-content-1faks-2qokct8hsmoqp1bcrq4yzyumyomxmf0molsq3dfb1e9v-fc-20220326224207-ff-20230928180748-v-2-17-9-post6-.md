description: The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a central role in
  the development of cancer metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy. However, its
  pharmacological treatment remains challenging. Here, we used an EMT-focused integrative
  functional genomic approach and identified an inverse association between short-chain
  fatty acids (propionate and butanoate) and EMT in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  patients. Remarkably, treatment with propionate in vitro reinforced the ...
