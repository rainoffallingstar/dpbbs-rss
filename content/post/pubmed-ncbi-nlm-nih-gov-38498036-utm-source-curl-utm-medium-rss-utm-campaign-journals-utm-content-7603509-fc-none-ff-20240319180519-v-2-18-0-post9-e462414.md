description: Patients with T- and NK-cell neoplasms frequently have somatic STAT5B
  gain-of-function mutations. The most frequent STAT5B mutation is STAT5BN642H, which
  is known to drive murine T-cell leukemia although its role in NK-cell malignancies
  is unclear. Introduction of the STAT5BN642H mutation into human NK-cell lines enhances
  their potential to induce leukemia in mice. We have generated a mouse model that
  enables tissue-specific expression of STAT5BN642H and have selectively expressed
  the ...
