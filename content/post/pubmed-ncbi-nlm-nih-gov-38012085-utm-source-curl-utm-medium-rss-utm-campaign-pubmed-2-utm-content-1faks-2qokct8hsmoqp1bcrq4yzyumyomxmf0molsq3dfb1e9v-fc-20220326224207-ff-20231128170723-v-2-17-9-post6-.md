description: The current state-of-the-art analysis of central nervous system (CNS)
  tumors through DNA methylation profiling relies on the tumor classifier developed
  by Capper and colleagues, which centrally harnesses DNA methylation data provided
  by users. Here, we present a distributed-computing-based approach for CNS tumor
  classification that achieves a comparable performance to centralized systems while
  safeguarding privacy. We utilize the t-distributed neighborhood embedding (t-SNE)
