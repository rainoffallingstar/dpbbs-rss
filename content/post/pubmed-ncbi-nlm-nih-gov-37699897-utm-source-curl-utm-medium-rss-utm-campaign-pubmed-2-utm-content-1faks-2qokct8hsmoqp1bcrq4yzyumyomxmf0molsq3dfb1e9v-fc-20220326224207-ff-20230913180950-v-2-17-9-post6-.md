description: The postnatal interaction between microbiota and the immune system establishes
  lifelong homeostasis at mucosal epithelial barriers, however, the barrier-specific
  physiological activities that drive the equilibrium are hardly known. During weaning,
  the oral epithelium, which is monitored by Langerhans cells (LC), is challenged
  by the development of a microbial plaque and the initiation of masticatory forces
  capable of damaging the epithelium. Here we show that microbial colonization ...
