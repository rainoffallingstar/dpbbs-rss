description: From signaling mediators in stem cells, to markers of differentiation
  and lineage commitment, to facilitators for the entry of viruses like HIV-1, cell
  surface heparan sulfate (HS) glycans with their distinct modification patterns play
  important roles in hematopoietic biology. In this review, we provide an overview
  of the importance of HS and the proteoglycans (HSPGs) to which they are attached,
  within the major cellular subtypes of the hematopoietic system. We summarize the
  roles of HSPGs, ...
