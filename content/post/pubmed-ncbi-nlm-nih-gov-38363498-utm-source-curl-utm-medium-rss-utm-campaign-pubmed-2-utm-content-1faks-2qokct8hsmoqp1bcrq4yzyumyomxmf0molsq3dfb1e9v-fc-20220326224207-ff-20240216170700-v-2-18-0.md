description: Cerebellar atrophy is the neuropathological hallmark of most ataxias.
  Hence, quantifying the volume of the cerebellar grey and white matter is of great
  interest. In this study, we aim to identify volume differences in the cerebellum
  between spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), SCA3 and SCA6 as well as multiple
  system atrophy of cerebellar type (MSA-C). Our cross-sectional data set comprised
  mutation carriers of SCA1 (N=12), SCA3 (N=62), SCA6 (N=14), as well as MSA-C patients
  (N=16). ...
