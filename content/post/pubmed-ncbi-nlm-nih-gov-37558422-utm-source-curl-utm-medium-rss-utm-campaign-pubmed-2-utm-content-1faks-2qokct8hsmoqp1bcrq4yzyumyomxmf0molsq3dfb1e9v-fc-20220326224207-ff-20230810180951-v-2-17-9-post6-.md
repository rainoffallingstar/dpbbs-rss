description: RIG-I recognizes viral dsRNA and activates a cell-autonomous antiviral
  response. Upon stimulation, it triggers a signaling cascade leading to the production
  of type I and III IFNs. IFNs are secreted and signal to elicit the expression of
  IFN-stimulated genes, establishing an antiviral state of the cell. The topology
  of this pathway has been studied intensively, however, its exact dynamics are less
  understood. Here, we employed electroporation to synchronously activate RIG-I, enabling
