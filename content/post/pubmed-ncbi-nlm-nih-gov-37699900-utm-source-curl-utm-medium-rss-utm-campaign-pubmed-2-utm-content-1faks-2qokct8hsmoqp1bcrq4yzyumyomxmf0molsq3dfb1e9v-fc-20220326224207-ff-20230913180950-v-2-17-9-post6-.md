description: There is a strong medical need to develop suitable biomarkers to improve
  the diagnosis and treatment of depression, particularly in predicting response to
  certain therapeutic approaches such as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). MicroRNAs
  are small non-coding RNAs that have the ability to influence the transcriptome as
  well as proteostasis at the systems level. Here, we investigate the role of circulating
  microRNAs in depression and response prediction towards ECT. Of the 64 patients
