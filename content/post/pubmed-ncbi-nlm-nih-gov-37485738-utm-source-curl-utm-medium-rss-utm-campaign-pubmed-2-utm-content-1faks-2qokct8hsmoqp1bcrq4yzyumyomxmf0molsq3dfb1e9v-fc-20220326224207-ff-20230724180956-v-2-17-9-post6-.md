description: Multi-omics analyses are used in microbiome studies to understand molecular
  changes in microbial communities exposed to different conditions. However, it is
  not always clear how much each omics data type contributes to our understanding
  and whether they are concordant with each other. Here, we map the molecular response
  of a synthetic community of 32 human gut bacteria to three non-antibiotic drugs
  by using five omics layers (16S rRNA gene profiling, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics,...
