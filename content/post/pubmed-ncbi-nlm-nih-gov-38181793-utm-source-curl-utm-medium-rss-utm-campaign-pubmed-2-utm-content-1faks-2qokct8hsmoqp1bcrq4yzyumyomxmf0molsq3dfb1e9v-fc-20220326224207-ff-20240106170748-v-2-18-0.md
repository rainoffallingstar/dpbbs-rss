description: A hallmark of animals is the coordination of whole-body movement. Neurons
  and muscles are central to this, yet coordinated movements also exist in sponges
  that lack these cell types. Sponges are sessile animals with a complex canal system
  for filter-feeding. They undergo whole-body movements resembling "contractions"
  that lead to canal closure and water expulsion. Here, we combine live 3D optical
  coherence microscopy, pharmacology, and functional proteomics to elucidate the sequence
