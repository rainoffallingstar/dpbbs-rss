description: Atherosclerosis, a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and
  mortality, is characterized by chronic inflammation of the arterial wall. This inflammatory
  process is initiated and maintained by both innate and adaptive immunity. Dendritic
  cells (DCs), which are antigen-presenting cells, play a crucial role in the development
  of atherosclerosis and consist of various subtypes with distinct functional abilities.
  Following the recognition and binding of antigens, DCs become potent ...
