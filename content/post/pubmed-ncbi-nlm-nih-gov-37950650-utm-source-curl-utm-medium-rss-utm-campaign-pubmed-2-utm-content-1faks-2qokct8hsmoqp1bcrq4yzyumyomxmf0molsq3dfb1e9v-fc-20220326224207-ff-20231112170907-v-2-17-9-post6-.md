description: Cancer-related fatigue is a frequent, burdensome and often insufficiently
  treated symptom. A more targeted treatment of fatigue is urgently needed. Therefore,
  we examined biomarkers and clinical factors to identify fatigue subtypes with potentially
  different pathophysiologies. The study population comprised disease-free breast
  cancer survivors of a German population-based case-control study who were re-assessed
  on average 6 (FU1, n = 1871) and 11 years (FU2, n = 1295) after diagnosis. At FU1
