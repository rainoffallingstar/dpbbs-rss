description: Additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric materials enables the manufacturing
  of complex structures for a wide range of applications. Among AM methods vat photopolymerization
  (VP) is desired owing to improved efficiency, excellent surface finish, and printing
  resolution at the micron-scale. Nevertheless, the major portion of resins available
  for VP are based on systems with limited or negligible recyclability. Here, we describe
  an approach that enables the printing of a resin that is amenable ...
