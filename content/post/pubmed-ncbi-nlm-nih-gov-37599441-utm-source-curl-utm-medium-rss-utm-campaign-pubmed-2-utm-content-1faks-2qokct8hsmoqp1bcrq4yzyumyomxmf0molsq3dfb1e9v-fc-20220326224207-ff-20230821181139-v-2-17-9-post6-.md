description: A challenge when developing therapeutic antibodies is the identification
  of candidates with favorable pharmacokinetics (PK) early in development. A key determinant
  of immunoglobulin (IgG) serum half‑life in vivo is the efficiency of pH-dependent
  binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Numerous studies have proposed techniques
  to assess FcRn binding of IgG-based therapeutics in vitro, enabling prediction of
  serum half-life prior to clinical assessment. FcRn high-performance ...
