description: Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been associated with
  immune evasion and tumor progression. We show that the RNA-sensing receptor RIG-I
  within tumor cells governs biogenesis and immunomodulatory function of EVs. Cancer-intrinsic
  RIG-I activation releases EVs, which mediate dendritic cell maturation and T cell
  antitumor immunity, synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. Intact RIG-I, autocrine
  interferon signaling, and the GTPase Rab27a in tumor cells are required ...
