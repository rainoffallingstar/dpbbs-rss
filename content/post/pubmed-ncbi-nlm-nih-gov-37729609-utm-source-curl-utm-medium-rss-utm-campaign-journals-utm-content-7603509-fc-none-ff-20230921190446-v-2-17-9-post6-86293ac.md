description: Polycythemia vera (PV) belongs to the BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative
  neoplasms and is characterized by activating mutations in JAK2 and clinically presents
  with erythrocytosis, variable degrees of systemic and vasomotor symptoms, and an
  increased risk of both thromboembolic events and progression to myelofibrosis and
