description: Currently, the world's only source of low-energy antiprotons is the AD/ELENA
  facility located at CERN. To date, all precision measurements on single antiprotons
  have been conducted at this facility and provide stringent tests of fundamental
  interactions and their symmetries. However, magnetic field fluctuations from the
  facility operation limit the precision of upcoming measurements. To overcome this
  limitation, we have designed the transportable antiproton trap system BASE-STEP
