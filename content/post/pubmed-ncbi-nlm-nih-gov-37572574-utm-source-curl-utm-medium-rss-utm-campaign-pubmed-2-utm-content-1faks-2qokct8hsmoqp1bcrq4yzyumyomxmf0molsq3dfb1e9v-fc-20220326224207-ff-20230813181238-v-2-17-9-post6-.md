description: Recessive variants in NDUFAF3 are a known cause of complex I (CI)-related
  mitochondrial disorders (MDs). The seven patients reported to date exhibited severe
  neurologic symptoms and lactic acidosis, followed by a fatal course and death during
  infancy in most cases. We present a 10-year-old patient with a neurodevelopmental
  disorder, progressive exercise intolerance, dystonia, basal ganglia abnormalities,
  and elevated lactate concentration in blood. Trio-exome sequencing ...
