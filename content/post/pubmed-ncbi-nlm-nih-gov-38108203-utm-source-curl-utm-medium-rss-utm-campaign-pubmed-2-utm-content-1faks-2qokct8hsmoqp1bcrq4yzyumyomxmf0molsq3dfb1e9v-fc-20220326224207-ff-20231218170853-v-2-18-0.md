description: Infection by certain pathogens is associated with cancer development.
  We conducted a case-cohort study of ~2500 incident cases of esophageal, gastric
  and duodenal cancer, and gastric and duodenal ulcer and a randomly selected subcohort
  of ~2000 individuals within the China Kadoorie Biobank study of >0.5 million adults.
  We used a bead-based multiplex serology assay to measure antibodies against 19 pathogens
  (total 43 antigens) in baseline plasma samples. Associations between pathogens ...
