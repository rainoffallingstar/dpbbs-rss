description: Aberrant skipping of coding exons in CD19 and CD22 compromises responses
  to immunotherapy for B-cell malignancies. Here, we show that the MS4A1 gene encoding
  human CD20 also produces several mRNA isoforms with distinct 5' untranslated regions
  (5'-UTR). Four variants (V1-4) were detectable by RNA-seq in distinct stages of
  normal B-cell differentiation and B-lymphoid malignancies, with V1 and V3 being
  the most abundant by far. During B-cell activation and Epstein-Barr virus infection,
