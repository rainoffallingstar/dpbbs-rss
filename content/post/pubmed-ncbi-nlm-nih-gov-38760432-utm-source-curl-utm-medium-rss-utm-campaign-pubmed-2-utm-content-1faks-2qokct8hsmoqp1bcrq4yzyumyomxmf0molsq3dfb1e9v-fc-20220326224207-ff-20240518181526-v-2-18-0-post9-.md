  rings remains controversial. Here we introduce a supramolecular stabilization approach
  of a cationic {Bi(4)} rhomboid within the symmetric charge sphere of two bowl-shaped
  dianionic calix[4]pyrrolato indinates. Crystallographic and spectroscopic characterization,
  quantum chemical analysis and magnetically induced ring currents indicate σ-aromaticity
