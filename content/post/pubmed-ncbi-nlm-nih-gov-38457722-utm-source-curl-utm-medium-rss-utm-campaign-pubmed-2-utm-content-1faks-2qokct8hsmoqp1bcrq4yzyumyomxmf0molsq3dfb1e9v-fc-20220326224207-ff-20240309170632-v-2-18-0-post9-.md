description: The first observation of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed Ω_{c}^{0}→Ω^{-}K^{+}
  and Ω_{c}^{0}→Ξ^{-}π^{+} decays is reported, using proton-proton collision data
  at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity
  of 5.4 fb^{-1}, collected with the LHCb detector between 2016 and 2018. The branching
  fraction ratios are measured to ...
