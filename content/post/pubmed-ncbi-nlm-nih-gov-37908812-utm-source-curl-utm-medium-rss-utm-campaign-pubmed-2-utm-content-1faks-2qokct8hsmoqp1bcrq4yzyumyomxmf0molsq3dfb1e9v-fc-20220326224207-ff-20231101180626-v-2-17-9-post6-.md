description: Previous research on Bayesian reasoning has typically investigated people's
  ability to assess a posterior probability (i.e., a positive predictive value) based
  on prior knowledge (i.e., base rate, true-positive rate, and false-positive rate).
  In this article, we systematically examine the extent to which people understand
  the effects of changes in the three input probabilities on the positive predictive
