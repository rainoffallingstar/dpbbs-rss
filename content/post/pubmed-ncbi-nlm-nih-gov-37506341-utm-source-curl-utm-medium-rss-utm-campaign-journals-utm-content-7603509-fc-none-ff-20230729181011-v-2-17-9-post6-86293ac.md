description: Germline variants in the DDX41 gene have been linked to myelodysplastic
  syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development. However, the risks
  associated with different variants remain unknown, as do the basis of their leukemogenic
  properties, impact on steady-state hematopoiesis and links to other cancers. Here,
  we investigate the frequency and significance of DDX41 variants in 454,792 United
  Kingdom Biobank (UKB) participants and identify 452 unique non-synonymous DNA variants
