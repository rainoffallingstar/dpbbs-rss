description: Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked disorder characterized
  by combined immunodeficiency, eczema, microthrombocytopenia, autoimmunity, and lymphoid
  malignancies. Gene therapy (GT) to modify autologous CD34+ cells is an emerging
  alternative treatment with advantages over standard allogeneic hematopoietic stem
  cell transplant for patients who lack well-matched donors, avoiding graft-versus-host-disease.
  We report the outcomes of a phase I/II clinical trial in which 5 patients ...
