description: A search for events with a dark photon produced in association with a
  dark Higgs boson via rare decays of the standard model Z boson is presented, using
  139 fb^{-1} of sqrt[s]=13 TeV proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS
  detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dark boson decays into a pair of dark
  photons, and at least two of the three dark photons must each decay into a pair
  of electrons or muons, resulting in at least two same-flavor opposite-charge lepton
  pairs in the ...
