description: Tumor recognition by T cells is essential for antitumor immunity. A comprehensive
  characterization of T cell diversity may be key to understanding the success of
  immunomodulatory drugs and failure of PD-1 blockade in tumors such as multiple myeloma
  (MM). Here, we use single-cell RNA and T cell receptor sequencing to characterize
  bone marrow T cells from healthy adults (n = 4) and patients with precursor (n =
  8) and full-blown MM (n = 10). Large T cell clones from patients with MM ...
