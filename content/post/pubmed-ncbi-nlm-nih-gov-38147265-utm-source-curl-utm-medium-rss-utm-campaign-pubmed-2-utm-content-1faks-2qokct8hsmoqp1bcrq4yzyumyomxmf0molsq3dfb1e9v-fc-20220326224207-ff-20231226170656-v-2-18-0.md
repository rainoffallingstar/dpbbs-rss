description: Hyperpolarization techniques significantly enhance the sensitivity of
  magnetic resonance (MR) and thus present fascinating new directions for research
  and applications with in vivo MR imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S). Hyperpolarized
  ^(13)C MRI/S, in particular, enables real-time non-invasive assessment of metabolic
  processes and holds great promise for a diverse range of clinical applications spanning
  fields like oncology, neurology, and cardiology, with a potential for improving
