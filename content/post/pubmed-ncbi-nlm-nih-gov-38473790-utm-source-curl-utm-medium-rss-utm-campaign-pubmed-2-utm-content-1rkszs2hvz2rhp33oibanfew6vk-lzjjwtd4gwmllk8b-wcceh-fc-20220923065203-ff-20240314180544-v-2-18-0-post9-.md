description: Adrenal myelolipomas (AML) are composed of mature adipose and hematopoietic
  components. They represent approximately 3 percent of adrenal tumors and are commonly
  found in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH provides a unique
  environment to explore AML pathogenesis. We aimed to evaluate the role of the immune
  system and hormones that accumulate in poorly controlled CAH in the development
  of AML. When compared to normal adrenal tissue, CAH-affected adrenal tissue ...
