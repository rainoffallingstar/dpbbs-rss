description: A search is made for potential ccc[over ¯]c[over ¯] tetraquarks decaying
  into a pair of charmonium states in the four muon final state using proton-proton
  collision data at sqrt[s]=13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140
  fb^{-1} recorded by the ATLAS experiment at LHC. Two decay channels, J/ψ+J/ψ→4μ
  and J/ψ+ψ(2S)→4μ, are studied. Backgrounds are estimated based on a hybrid approach
  involving Monte Carlo simulations and data-driven methods. Statistically significant
