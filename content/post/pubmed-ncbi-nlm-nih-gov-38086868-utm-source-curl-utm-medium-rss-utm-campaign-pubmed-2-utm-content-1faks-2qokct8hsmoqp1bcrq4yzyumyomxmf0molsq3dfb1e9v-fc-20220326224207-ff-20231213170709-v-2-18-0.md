description: Physical capacity prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT)
  has been shown as a relevant prognostic factor for survival after transplant. Therefore,
  we evaluated feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a high-intensity interval training
  (HIIT) and moderate to high-intensity resistance exercise (RE) to increase physical
  capacity in patient's prior allo-HCT. In this multicentre single arm pilot study,
  a supervised exercise program was performed twice weekly for 4-12 weeks ...
