description: During brain development, neural progenitors expand through symmetric
  divisions before giving rise to differentiating cell types via asymmetric divisions.
  Transition between those modes varies among individual neural stem cells, resulting
  in clones of different sizes. Imaging-based lineage tracing allows for lineage analysis
  at high cellular resolution but systematic approaches to analyse clonal behaviour
  of entire tissues are currently lacking. Here we implement whole-tissue lineage
