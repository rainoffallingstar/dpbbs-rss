description: Improving the scalability of tissue imaging throughput with bright, coherent
  X-rays requires identifying and mitigating artifacts resulting from the interactions
  between X-rays and matter. At synchrotron sources, long-term imaging of soft tissues
  in solution can result in gas bubble formation or cavitation, which dramatically
  compromises image quality and integrity of the samples. By combining in-line phase-contrast
  imaging with gas chromatography in real time, we were able to track the ...
