description: The organization of fear memory involves the participation of multiple
  brain regions. However, it is largely unknown how fear memory is formed, which circuit
  pathways are used for "printing" memory engrams across brain regions, and the role
  of identified brain circuits in memory retrieval. With advanced genetic methods,
  we combinatorially blocked presynaptic output and manipulated N-methyl-D-aspartate
  receptor (NMDAR) in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial prefrontal cortex
  (mPFC) ...
