description: Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), including αβ and γδ T cells (T-IELs),
  constantly survey and play a critical role in maintaining the gastrointestinal epithelium.
  We show that cytotoxic molecules important for defense against cancer were highly
  expressed by T-IELs in the small intestine. In contrast, abundance of colonic T-IELs
  was dependent on the microbiome and displayed higher expression of TCF-1/TCF7 and
  a reduced effector and cytotoxic profile, including low expression of ...
