description: Enteric bacterial infections caused by Salmonella, Shigella, pathogenic
  Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter represent one of the most common causes of infectious
  enteritis worldwide. The timely and accurate diagnosis of pathogens causing gastroenteritis
  is crucial for patient care, public health, and disease surveillance. While stool
  culture has long been the standard and highly specific method for detecting enteric
  pathogens, it is labor-intensive and time-consuming with limited sensitivity. ...
