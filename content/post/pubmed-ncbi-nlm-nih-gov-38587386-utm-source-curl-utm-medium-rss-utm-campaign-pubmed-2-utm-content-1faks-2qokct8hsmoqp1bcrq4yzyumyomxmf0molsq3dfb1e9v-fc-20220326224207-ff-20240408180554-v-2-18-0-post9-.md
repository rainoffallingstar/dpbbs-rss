description: This protocol details the propagation and passaging of human iPSCs and
  their differentiation into osteoclasts. First, iPSCs are dissociated into a single-cell
  suspension for further use in embryoid body induction. Following mesodermal induction,
  embryoid bodies undergo hematopoietic differentiation, producing a floating hematopoietic
  cell population. Subsequently, the harvested hematopoietic cells undergo a macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor maturation step and, finally, ...
