description: Studies have shown that colorectal cancer prognosis can be predicted
  by deep learning-based analysis of histological tissue sections of the primary tumor.
  So far, this has been achieved using a binary prediction. Survival curves might
  contain more detailed information and thus enable a more fine-grained risk prediction.
  Therefore, we established survival curve-based CRC survival predictors and benchmarked
  them against standard binary survival predictors, comparing their performance ...
