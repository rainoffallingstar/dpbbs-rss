description: The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of ultrashort echo
  time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques (T1 and magnetization transfer
  [MT] modeling) for imaging of the Achilles tendons and entheses in patients with
  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) compared with asymptomatic volunteers. The heels of twenty-six
  PsA patients (age 59 ± 15 years, 41% female) and twenty-seven asymptomatic volunteers
  (age 33 ± 11 years, 47% female) were scanned in the sagittal plane with UTE-T1 ...
