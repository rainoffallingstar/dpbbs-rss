description: The exact function of M1 macrophages and CXCL9 in forecasting the effectiveness
  of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is still not thoroughly investigated. We
  investigated the potential of M1 macrophage and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 9 (CXCL9)
  as predictive markers for ICI efficacy, employing a comprehensive approach integrating
  multicohort analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing. A significant correlation between
  high M1 macrophage and improved overall survival (OS) and objective ...
