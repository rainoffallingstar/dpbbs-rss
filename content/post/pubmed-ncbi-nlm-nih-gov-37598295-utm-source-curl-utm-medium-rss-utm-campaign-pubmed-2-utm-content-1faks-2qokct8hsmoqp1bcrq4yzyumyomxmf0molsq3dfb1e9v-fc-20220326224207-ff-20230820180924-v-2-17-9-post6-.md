  motor neuron degeneration and progressive life-limiting motor deficits if untreated.
  Onasemnogene abeparvovec is an adeno-associated virus serotype 9-based gene therapy
  that improves survival, motor function, and motor milestone achievement in symptomatic
  and presymptomatic patients. Although the adeno-associated virus genome is maintained
  as an episome, theoretical risk of tumorigenicity persists should genomic ...
