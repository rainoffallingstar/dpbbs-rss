description: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) in trials has demonstrated favorable
  efficacy compared with historical controls after ≥2 lines of therapy for the treatment
  of relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL). Herein, we compared
  the real-world effectiveness of axi-cel with efficacy and effectiveness of chemoimmunotherapy
  (CIT) in patients aged ≥65 years and patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology
  Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 2. A total of 1146 patients treated ...
