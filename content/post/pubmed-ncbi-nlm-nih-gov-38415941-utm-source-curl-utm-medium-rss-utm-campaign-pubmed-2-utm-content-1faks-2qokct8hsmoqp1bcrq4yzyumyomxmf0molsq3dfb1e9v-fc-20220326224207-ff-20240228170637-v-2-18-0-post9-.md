description: The number of crystal structures of pertechnetates derived from aqueous
  solutions has been expanded from seven to over 30. We report the conversion of NH4TcO4
  to aqueous HTcO4 via acidic cation exchange. This is followed by the synthesis and
  structural elucidation of pertechnetate salts of alkaline earth (AE), transition
  metal (TM) and lanthanoids (Ln) elements. Various degrees of hydration and coordination
  are discussed. Where possible, a comparison with the perrhenate homologues is made.
