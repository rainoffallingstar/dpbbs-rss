description: Newborn screening (NBS) programs are effective measures of secondary
  prevention and have been successively extended. We aimed to evaluate NBS for methylmalonic
  acidurias, propionic acidemia, homocystinuria, remethylation disorders and neonatal
  vitamin B(12) deficiency, and report on the identification of cofactor-responsive
  disease variants. This evaluation of the previously established combined multiple-tier
  NBS algorithm is part of the prospective pilot study "NGS2025" from August 2016
