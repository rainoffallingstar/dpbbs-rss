description: MDS Molecular International Prognostic Scoring SystemSamples from over
  2500 patients with MDS were profiled for gene mutations and used to develop the
  International Prognostic Scoring System-Molecular (IPSS-M). TP53^(multihit), FLT3
  mutations, and MLL^(PTD) were identified as top genetic predictors of adverse outcomes.
  IPSS-M improves prognostic discrimination across all clinical end points versus
