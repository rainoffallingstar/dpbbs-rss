description: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) influence the transcription of gene networks
  in many cell types, but their role in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is still
  largely unknown. We found that the lncRNA ADPGK-AS1 was substantially upregulated
  in artificially induced M2-like human macrophages, macrophages exposed to lung cancer
  cells in vitro, and TAMs from human lung cancer tissue. ADPGK-AS1 is partly located
  within mitochondria and binds to the mitochondrial ribosomal protein ...
