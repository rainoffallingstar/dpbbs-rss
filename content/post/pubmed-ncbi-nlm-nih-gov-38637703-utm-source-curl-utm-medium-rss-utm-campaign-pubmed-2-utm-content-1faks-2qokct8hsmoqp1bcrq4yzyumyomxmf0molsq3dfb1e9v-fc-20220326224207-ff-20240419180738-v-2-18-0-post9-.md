description: The rational development of small-molecule degraders (e.g., proteolysis
  targeting chimeras) remains a challenge as the rate-limiting steps that determine
  degrader efficiency are largely unknown. Standard methods in the field of targeted
  protein degradation mostly rely on classical, low-throughput endpoint assays such
  as western blots or quantitative proteomics. Here we applied NanoLuciferase- and
  HaloTag-based screening technologies to determine the kinetics and stability ...
