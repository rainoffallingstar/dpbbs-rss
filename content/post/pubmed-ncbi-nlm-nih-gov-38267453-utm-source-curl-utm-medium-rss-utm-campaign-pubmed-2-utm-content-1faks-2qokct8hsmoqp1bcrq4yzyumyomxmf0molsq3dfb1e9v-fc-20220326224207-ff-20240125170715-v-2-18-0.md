description: Excision of the initiator methionine is among the first co-translational
  processes that occur at the ribosome. While this crucial step in protein maturation
  is executed by two types of methionine aminopeptidases in eukaryotes (MAP1 and MAP2),
  additional roles in disease and translational regulation have drawn more attention
  to MAP2. Here, we report several cryo-EM structures of human and fungal MAP2 at
  the 80S ribosome. Irrespective of nascent chains, MAP2 can occupy the tunnel exit.
