description: Sarcomas comprise a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors of mesenchymal
  origin. More than 80 entities are associated with different mesenchymal lineages.
  Sarcomas with fibroblastic, muscle, bone, vascular, adipocytic, and other characteristics
  are distinguished. Nearly half of all entities contain specific chromosomal translocations
  that give rise to fusion proteins. These are mostly pathognomonic, and their detection
  by various molecular techniques supports histopathologic ...
