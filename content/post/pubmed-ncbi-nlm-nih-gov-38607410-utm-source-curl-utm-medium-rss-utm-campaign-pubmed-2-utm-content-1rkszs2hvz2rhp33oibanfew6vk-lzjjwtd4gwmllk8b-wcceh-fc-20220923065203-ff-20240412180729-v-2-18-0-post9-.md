description: The phase 3 INO-VATE trial demonstrated higher rates of remission, measurable
  residual disease negativity, and improved overall survival for patients with relapsed/refractory
  (R/R) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO)
  vs standard of care chemotherapy (SC). Here we examined associations between genomic
  alterations and the efficacy of InO. Of 326 randomized patients, 91 (InO, n=43;
  SC, n=48) had samples evaluable for genomic analysis. The spectrum of ...
