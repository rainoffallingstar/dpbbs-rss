description: Fundamental to effective Legionnaires' disease outbreak control is the
  ability to rapidly identify the environmental source(s) of the causative agent,
  Legionella pneumophila. Genomics has revolutionized pathogen surveillance, but L.
  pneumophila has a complex ecology and population structure that can limit source
  inference based on standard core genome phylogenetics. Here, we present a powerful
  machine learning approach that assigns the geographical source of Legionnaires'
  disease outbreaks ...
