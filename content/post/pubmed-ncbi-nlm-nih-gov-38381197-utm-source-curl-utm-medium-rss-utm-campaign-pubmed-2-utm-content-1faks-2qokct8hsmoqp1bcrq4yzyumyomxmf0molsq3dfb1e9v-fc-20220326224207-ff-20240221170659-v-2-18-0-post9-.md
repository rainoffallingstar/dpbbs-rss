description: This narrative review explores recent advancements and applications of
  modern low-field (≤ 1 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in musculoskeletal
  radiology. Historically, high-field MRI systems (1.5 T and 3 T) have been the standard
  in clinical practice due to superior image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.
  However, recent technological advancements in low-field MRI offer promising avenues
  for musculoskeletal imaging. General principles of low-field MRI systems are being
