description: The photophysics of organic semiconductor (OSC) thin films or crystals
  has garnered significant attention in recent years since a comprehensive theoretical
  understanding of the various processes occurring upon photoexcitation is crucial
  for assessing the efficiency of OSC materials. To date, research in this area has
  relied on methods using Frenkel-Holstein Hamiltonians, calculations of the GW-Bethe-Salpeter
  equation with periodic boundaries, or cluster-based approaches using quantum ...
