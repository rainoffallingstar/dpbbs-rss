description: Photochromism is a reversible phenomenon wherein a material undergoes
  a change in color upon exposure to light. In organic photochromes, this effect often
  results from light-induced isomerization reactions, leading to alterations in either
  the spatial orientation or electronic properties of the photochrome. The incorporation
  of photochromic moieties into biomolecules, such as proteins or nucleic acids, has
  become a prevalent approach to render these biomolecules responsive to light ...
