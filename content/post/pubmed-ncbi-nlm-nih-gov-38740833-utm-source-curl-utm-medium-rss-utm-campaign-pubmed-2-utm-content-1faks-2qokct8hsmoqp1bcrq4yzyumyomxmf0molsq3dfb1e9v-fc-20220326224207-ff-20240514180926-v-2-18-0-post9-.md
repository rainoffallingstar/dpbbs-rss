description: In contrast to acute diarrhoea, the aetiology of persistent digestive
  disorders (≥ 14 days) is poorly understood in low-resource settings and conventional
  diagnostic approaches lack accuracy. In this multi-country study, we compared multiplex
  real-time PCR for enteric bacterial, parasitic and viral pathogens in stool samples
  from symptomatic patients and matched asymptomatic controls in Côte d'Ivoire, Mali
  and Nepal. Among 1826 stool samples, the prevalence of most pathogens was highest
