description: Tract-specific microstructural analysis of the brain's white matter (WM)
  using diffusion MRI has been a driver for neuroscientific discovery with a wide
  range of applications. Tractometry enables localized tissue analysis along tracts
  but relies on bare summary statistics and reduces complex image information along
  a tract to few scalar values, and so may miss valuable information. This hampers
  the applicability of tractometry for predictive modelling. Radiomics is a promising
  method based ...
