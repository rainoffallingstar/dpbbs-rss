description: Correlation-driven charge migration initiated by inner-valence ionization
  leading to the population of the correlation bands of alkyne chains containing between
  4 and 12 carbon atoms is explored through ab initio simulations. Scaling laws are
  observed, both for the time scale of the charge migration and for the slope of the
  density of states of the correlation bands. These can be used for predicting the
  relaxation time scale in much larger systems from the same molecular family and
