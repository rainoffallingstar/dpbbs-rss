description: Acinetobacter baumannii has become a prominent nosocomial pathogen, primarily
  owing to its remarkable ability to rapidly acquire resistance to a wide range of
  antimicrobial agents and its ability to persist in diverse environments. However,
  there is a lack of data on the molecular epidemiology and its potential implications
  for public health of A. baumannii strains exhibiting clinically significant resistances
  that originate from non-clinical environments. Therefore, the genetic ...
