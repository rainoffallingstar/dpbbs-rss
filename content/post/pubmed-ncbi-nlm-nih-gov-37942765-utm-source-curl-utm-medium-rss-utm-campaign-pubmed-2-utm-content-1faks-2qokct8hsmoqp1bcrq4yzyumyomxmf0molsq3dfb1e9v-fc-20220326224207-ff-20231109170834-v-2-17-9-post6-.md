description: The potassium hexacyanoferrate(III), K(3)[Fe^(III)(CN)(6)], is known
  for its exceptional magnetic anisotropy among the 3d transition metal series. The
  Fe(III) ions are in the S = 1/2 low spin state imposed by the strong crystal field
  of the cyanido ligands. A large orbital magnetic moment is expected from previous
  publications. In the present work, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism was recorded
  for a powder sample, allowing direct measurement of the Fe(III) orbital magnetic
  moment. A ...
