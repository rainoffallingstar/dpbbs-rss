description: Precise delivery of genes to therapy-relevant cells is crucial for in
  vivo gene therapy. Receptor-targeting as prime strategy for this purpose is limited
  to cell types defined by a single cell-surface marker. Many target cells are characterized
  by combinations of more than one marker, such as the HIV reservoir cells. Here,
  we explored the tropism of adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV2) displaying designed
  ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) mono- and bispecific for CD4 and CD32a. ...
