description: Given the shortcomings of current factor-based, nonfactor-based, and
  AAV gene-based therapies, the recent advent of RNA-based therapeutics for hemophilia
  is changing the fundamental approach to hemophilia management. From siRNA therapeutics
  that knockdown clot regulators antithrombin, protein S, and heparin cofactor II,
  to CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing that may personalize treatment, improved technologies
  have the potential to reduce bleeds and factor use and avoid inhibitor formation.
