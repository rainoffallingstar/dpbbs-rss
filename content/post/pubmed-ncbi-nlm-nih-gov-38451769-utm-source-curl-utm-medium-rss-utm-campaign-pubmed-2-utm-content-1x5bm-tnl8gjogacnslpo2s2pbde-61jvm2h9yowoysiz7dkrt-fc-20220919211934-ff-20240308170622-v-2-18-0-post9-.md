description: Transcription factors (TFs) regulation is required for the vast majority
  of biological processes in living organisms. Some diseases may be caused by improper
  transcriptional regulation. Identifying the target genes of TFs is thus critical
  for understanding cellular processes and analyzing disease molecular mechanisms.
  Computational approaches can be challenging to employ when attempting to predict
  potential interactions between TFs and target genes. In this paper, we present a
  novel graph ...
