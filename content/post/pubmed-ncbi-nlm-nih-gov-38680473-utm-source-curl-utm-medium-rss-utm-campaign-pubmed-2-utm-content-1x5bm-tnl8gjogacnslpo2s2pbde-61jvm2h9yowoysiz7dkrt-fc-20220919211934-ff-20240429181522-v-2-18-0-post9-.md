description: The P2X7 receptor, a member of the P2X receptor family, plays a crucial
  role in various physiological processes, particularly pain perception. Its expression
  across immune, neuronal, and glial cells facilitates the release of pro-inflammatory
  molecules, thereby influencing pain development and maintenance, as evidenced by
  its association with pulpitis in rats. Notably, P2X receptors such as P2X3 and P2X7
  are pivotal in dental pain pathways, making them promising targets for novel ...
