description: Light provides a widely abundant energy source and valuable sensory cue
  in nature. Most animals exposed to light have photoreceptor cells and in addition
  to eyes, there are many extraocular strategies for light sensing. Here, we review
  how these simpler forms of detecting light can mediate rapid behavioural responses
  in animals. Examples of these behaviours include photophobic (light avoidance) or
  scotophobic (shadow) responses, photokinesis, phototaxis and wavelength discrimination.
