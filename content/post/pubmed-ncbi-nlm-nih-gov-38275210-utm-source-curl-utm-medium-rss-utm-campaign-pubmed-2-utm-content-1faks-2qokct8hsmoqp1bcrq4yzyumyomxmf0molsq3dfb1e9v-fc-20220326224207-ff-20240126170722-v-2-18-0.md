description: The design of discrete β-sheet peptides is far less advanced than e.g.
  the design of α-helical peptides. The reputation of β-sheet peptides as being poorly
  soluble and aggregation-prone often hinders active design efforts. Here, we show
  that this reputation is unfounded. We demonstrate this by looking at the β-hairpin
  and WW domain. Their structure and folding have been extensively studied and they
  have long served as model systems to investigate protein folding and folding kinetics.
