description: In multiple myeloma spatial differences in the subclonal architecture,
  molecular signatures and composition of the microenvironment remain poorly characterized.
  To address this shortcoming, we perform multi-region sequencing on paired random
  bone marrow and focal lesion samples from 17 newly diagnosed patients. Using single-cell
  RNA- and ATAC-seq we find a median of 6 tumor subclones per patient and unique subclones
  in focal lesions. Genetically identical subclones display different levels ...
