description: The diagnosis of ependymoma has moved from a purely histopathological
  review with limited prognostic value to an integrated diagnosis, relying heavily
  on molecular information. However, as the integrated approach is still novel and
  some molecular ependymoma subtypes are quite rare, few studies have correlated integrated
  pathology and clinical outcome, often focusing on small series of single molecular
  types. We collected data from 2023 ependymomas as classified by DNA methylation
