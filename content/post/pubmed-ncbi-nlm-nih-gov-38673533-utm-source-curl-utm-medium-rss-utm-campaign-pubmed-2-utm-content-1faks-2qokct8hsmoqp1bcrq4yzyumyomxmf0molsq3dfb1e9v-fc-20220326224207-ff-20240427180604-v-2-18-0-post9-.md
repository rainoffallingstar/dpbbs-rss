description: 'Background: The general movement optimality score (GMOS) quantifies
  the details of general movements (GMs). We recently conducted psychometric analyses
  of the GMOS and developed a revised scoresheet. Consequently, the GMOS-Revised (GMOS-R)
  instrument necessitated validation using new percentile ranks. This study aimed
  to provide these percentile ranks for the GMOS-R and to investigate whether sex,
  preterm birth, or the infant''s country of birth and residence affected the GMOS-R
