description: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition of pregnancy defined
  by new-onset hyperglycemia. GDM is associated with impaired maternal endothelial
  and vascular reactivity. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor that contributes
  to endothelial dysfunction, however, its abundance and actions in GDM are unclear.
  Maternal plasma was obtained from pregnancies complicated by GDM (n = 24) and gestation-matched
  controls (n = 42); circulating ET-1 levels were assessed by ELISA. ...
