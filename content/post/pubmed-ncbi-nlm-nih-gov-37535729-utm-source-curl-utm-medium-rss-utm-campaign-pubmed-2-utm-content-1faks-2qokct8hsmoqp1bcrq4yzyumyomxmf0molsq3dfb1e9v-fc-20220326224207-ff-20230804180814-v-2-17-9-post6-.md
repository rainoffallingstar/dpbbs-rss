description: Tumor microenvironments (TMEs) influence cancer progression but are complex
  and often differ between patients. Considering that microenvironment variations
  may reveal rules governing intratumoral cellular programs and disease outcome, we
  focused on tumor-to-tumor variation to examine 52 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
  We found that macrophage polarity-defined by CXCL9 and SPP1 (CS) expression but
  not by conventional M1 and M2 markers-had a noticeably strong prognostic association.
