description: The ongoing expansion of human genomic datasets propels therapeutic target
  identification; however, extracting gene-disease associations from gene annotations
  remains challenging. Here, we introduce Mantis-ML 2.0, a framework integrating AstraZeneca's
  Biological Insights Knowledge Graph and numerous tabular datasets, to assess gene-disease
  probabilities throughout the phenome. We use graph neural networks, capturing the
  graph's holistic structure, and train them on hundreds of balanced ...
