description: The timely diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is of paramount
  importance for enhancing the treatment efficacy and the survival rates of patients.
  In this study, we seek to introduce an ensemble-ALL model for the image classification
  of ALL, with the goal of enhancing early diagnostic capabilities and streamlining
  the diagnostic and treatment processes for medical practitioners. In this study,
  a publicly available dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and test
  sets. ...
