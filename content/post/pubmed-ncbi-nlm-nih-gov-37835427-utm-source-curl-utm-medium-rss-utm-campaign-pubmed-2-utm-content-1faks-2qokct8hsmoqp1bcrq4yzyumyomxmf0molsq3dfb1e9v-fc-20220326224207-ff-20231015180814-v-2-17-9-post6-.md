description: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) is characterised by diverse
  genomic alterations, the most frequent being gene fusions detected via transcriptomic
  analysis (mRNA-seq). Due to its hypervariable nature, gene fusions involving the
  Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain (IGH) locus can be difficult to detect with standard
  gene fusion calling algorithms and significant computational resources and analysis
  times are required. We aimed to optimize a gene fusion calling workflow to achieve
