description: Optimal conditioning prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  for children with non-malignant diseases is subject of ongoing research. This prospective,
  randomized, phase 2 trial compared safety and efficacy of busulfan with treosulfan
  based preparative regimens. Children with non-malignant diseases received fludarabine
  and either intravenous (IV) busulfan (4.8 to 3.2 mg/kg/day) or IV treosulfan (10,
  12, or 14 g/m²/day). Thiotepa administration (2 × 5 mg/kg) was at ...
