description: Hard-tissue histology-the analysis of thin two-dimensional (2D) sections-is
  hampered by the opaque nature of most biological specimens, especially bone. Therefore,
  the cutting process cannot be assigned to regions of interest. In addition, the
  applied cutting-grinding method is characterized by significant material loss. As
  a result, relevant structures might be missed or destroyed, and 3D features can
  hardly be evaluated. Here, we present a novel workflow, based on conventual microCT
  scans ...
