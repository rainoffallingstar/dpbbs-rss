description: It's another month in AI research, and it's hard to pick favorites. This
  month, I am going over a paper that discusses strategies for the continued pretraining
  of LLMs, followed by a discussion of reward modeling used in reinforcement learning
  with human feedback (a popular LLM alignment method), along with a new benchmark.
  Continued pretraining for LLMs is an important topic because it allows us to update
  existing LLMs, for instance, ensuring that these models remain up-to-date with the
  latest information and trends. Also, it allows us to adapt them to new target domains
  without having them ...
