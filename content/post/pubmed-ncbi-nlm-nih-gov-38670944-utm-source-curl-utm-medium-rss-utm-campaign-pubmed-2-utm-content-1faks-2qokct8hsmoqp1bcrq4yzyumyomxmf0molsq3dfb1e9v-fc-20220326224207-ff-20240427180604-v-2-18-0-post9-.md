description: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 200
  common genetic variants independently associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk,
  but the causal variants and target genes are mostly unknown. We sought to fine-map
  all known CRC risk loci using GWAS data from 100,204 cases and 154,587 controls
  of East Asian and European ancestry. Our stepwise conditional analyses revealed
  238 independent association signals of CRC risk, each with a set of credible causal
  variants (CCVs), ...
