description: Stuttering is a common speech disorder that interrupts speech fluency
  and tends to cluster in families. Typically, stuttering is characterized by speech
  sounds, words or syllables which may be repeated or prolonged and speech that may
  be further interrupted by hesitations or 'blocks'. Rare variants in a small number
  of genes encoding lysosomal pathway proteins have been linked to stuttering. We
  studied a large four-generation family in which persistent stuttering was inherited
