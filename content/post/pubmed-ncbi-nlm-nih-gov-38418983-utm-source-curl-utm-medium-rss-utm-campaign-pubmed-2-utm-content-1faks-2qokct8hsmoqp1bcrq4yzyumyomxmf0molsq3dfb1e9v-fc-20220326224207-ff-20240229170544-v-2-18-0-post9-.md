description: Liver steatosis is the most frequent liver disorder and its advanced
  stage, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), will soon become the main reason for
  liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. The "multiple hits hypothesis" suggests that progression
  from simple steatosis to NASH is triggered by multiple factors including the gut
  microbiota composition. The Epstein Barr virus induced gene 2 (EBI2) is a receptor
  for the oxysterol 7a, 25-dihydroxycholesterol synthesized by the enzymes CH25H and
  CYP7B1. ...
