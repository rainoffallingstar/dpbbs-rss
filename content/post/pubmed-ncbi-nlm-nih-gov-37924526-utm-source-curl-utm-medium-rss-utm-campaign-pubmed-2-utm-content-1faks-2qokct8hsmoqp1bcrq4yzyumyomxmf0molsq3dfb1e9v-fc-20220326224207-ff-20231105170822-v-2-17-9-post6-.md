description: Mast cells (MCs) accumulate in a broad range of tumors, including melanomas.
  While MCs are potent initiators of immunity in infection, and in allergic inflammation,
  the function of MCs in anti-melanoma immunity is unclear. MCs have the potential
  to release tumoricidal cytokines and proteases, to activate antigen-presenting cells
  and to promote anti-tumor adaptive immunity. However, within the immunosuppressive
