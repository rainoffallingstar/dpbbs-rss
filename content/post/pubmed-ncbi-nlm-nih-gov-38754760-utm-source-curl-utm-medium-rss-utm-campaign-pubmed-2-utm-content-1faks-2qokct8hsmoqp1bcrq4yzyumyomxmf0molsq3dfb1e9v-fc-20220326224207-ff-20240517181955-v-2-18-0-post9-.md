description: Reinforced cementoplasty with spindles is a recent technique that is
  mainly used for pathological fractures or for bone metastases at risk of fracture
  in locations with shear stresses. The technique is less challenging to perform than
  percutaneous screw insertion and does not require equipment sterilization. No general
  anesthetic is required. A small trocar is all that is needed, and sutures are often
  unnecessary. Reinforced cementoplasty can therefore be considered as a technical
  evolution ...
