description: Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is more abundant in feces than in serum;
  however, evidence for the role of fecal CEA (FCEA) in the detection of colorectal
  cancer (CRC) is limited. We conducted a systematic review of studies that evaluated
  FCEA for the noninvasive detection and diagnosis of CRC. PubMed and Web of Science
  were searched for relevant studies published until 18 January 2023. Information
  on publication year, study design, country, study population characteristics, FCEA
  and serum ...
