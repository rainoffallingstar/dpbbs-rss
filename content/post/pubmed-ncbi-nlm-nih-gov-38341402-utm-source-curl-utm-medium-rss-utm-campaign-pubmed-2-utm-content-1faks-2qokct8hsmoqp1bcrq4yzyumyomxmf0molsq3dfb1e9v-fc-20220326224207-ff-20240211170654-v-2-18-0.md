description: Deep Learning (DL) can predict biomarkers from cancer histopathology.
  Several clinically approved applications use this technology. Most approaches, however,
  predict categorical labels, whereas biomarkers are often continuous measurements.
  We hypothesize that regression-based DL outperforms classification-based DL. Therefore,
  we develop and evaluate a self-supervised attention-based weakly supervised regression
  method that predicts continuous biomarkers directly from 11,671 images of ...
