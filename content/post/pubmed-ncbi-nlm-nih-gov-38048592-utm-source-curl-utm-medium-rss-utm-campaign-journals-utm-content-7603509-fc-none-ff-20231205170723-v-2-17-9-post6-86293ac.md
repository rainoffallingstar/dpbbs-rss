description: Determining fitness for intensive chemotherapy in an older adult with
  acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an unanswered age-old question. Geriatric assessment
  captures any variation in multidimensional health, which can influence treatment
  tolerance. A prospective study is necessary to validate fitness criteria, determine
  whether geriatric assessment-based fitness performs superiorly to other criteria,
  and what components of geriatric assessment are associated with treatment tolerance.
