description: The process of osmosis, a fundamental phenomenon in life, drives water
  through a semipermeable membrane in response to a solute concentration gradient
  across this membrane. In vitro, osmotic shocks are often used to drive shape changes
  in lipid vesicles, for instance, to study fission events in the context of artificial
  cells. While experimental techniques provide a macroscopic picture of large-scale
  membrane remodeling processes, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful
  tool to ...
