description: Differentiating between various intraocular lens (IOL) changes can be
  a challenge. In particular, certain IOL models carry the risk of late postoperative
  calcification. A major cause of IOL exchange surgery could be avoided if appropriate
  modifications were made during the IOL manufacturing process. The use of a hydrophilic
  acrylate carries the risk of IOL calcification, especially when a secondary procedure,
  such as a pars plana vitrectomy or other procedures using gas or air, is performed.
