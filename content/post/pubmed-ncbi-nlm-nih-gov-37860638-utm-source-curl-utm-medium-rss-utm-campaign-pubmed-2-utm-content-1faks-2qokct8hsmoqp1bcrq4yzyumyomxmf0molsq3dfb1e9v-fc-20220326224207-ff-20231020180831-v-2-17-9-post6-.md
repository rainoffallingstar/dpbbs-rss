description: The silicon-carbon bond is a valuable linchpin for synthetic transformations.
  However, installing Si-C functionalities requires metalated C-nucleophiles, activated
  silicon reagents (silylium ions, silyl radicals, and silyl anions), or transition
  metal catalysis, and it occurs irreversibly. In contrast, spontaneous C-H silylations
  with neutral silanes leading to anionic silicates, and their reversible deconstruction,
  are elusive. Herein, the CH-bond silylation of heterocycles or a terminal ...
