description: Subchondral bone remodeling, mediated by osteocytes within the lacuno-canalicular
  network, plays a crucial role in osteoarthritis (OA) progression. Following cell
  death, lacunae preserve integrity, offering insights into bone remodeling mechanisms.
  Limited and controversial data on osteocyte lacuna morphology in OA result from
  small sample sizes and two-dimensional (2D) techniques that have been used thus
  far. This study aimed to quantify three-dimensional (3D) osteocyte lacunar ...
