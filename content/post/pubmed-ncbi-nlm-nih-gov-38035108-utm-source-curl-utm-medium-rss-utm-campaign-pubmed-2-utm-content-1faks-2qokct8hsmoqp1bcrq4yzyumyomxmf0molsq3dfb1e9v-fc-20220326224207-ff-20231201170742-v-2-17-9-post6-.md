description: MICA is a stress-induced ligand of the NKG2D receptor that stimulates
  NK and T cell responses and was identified as a key determinant of anti-tumor immunity.
  The MICA gene is located inside the MHC complex and is in strong linkage disequilibrium
  with HLA-B. While an HLA-B*48-linked MICA deletion-haplotype was previously described
  in Asian populations, little is known about other MICA copy number variations. Here,
  we report the genotyping of more than two million individuals revealing ...
