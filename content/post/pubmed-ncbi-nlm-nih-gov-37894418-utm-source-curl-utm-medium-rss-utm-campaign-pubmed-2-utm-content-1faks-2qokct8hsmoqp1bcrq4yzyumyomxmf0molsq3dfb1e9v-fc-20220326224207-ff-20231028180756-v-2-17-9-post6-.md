description: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by a high degree
  of intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). Besides genomic ITH, there is considerable
  functional ITH, which encompasses spatial niches with distinct proliferative and
  signaling activities. The full extent of functional spatial heterogeneity in ccRCC
  is incompletely understood. In the present study, a total of 17 ccRCC tissue specimens
  from different sites (primary tumor, n = 11; local recurrence, n = 1; distant metastasis,
