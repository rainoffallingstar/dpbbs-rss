description: Digital precision medicine is gaining increasing importance in rhythmology,
  especially in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. This trend is driven by the
  advancing digitization in healthcare and the availability of large amounts of data
  from various sources such as electrocardiograms (ECGs), implants like pacemakers
  and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), as well as wearables like smartwatches
  and fitness trackers. Through the analysis of this data, physicians can develop
