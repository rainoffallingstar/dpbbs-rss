description: N-formylation is a common pre- and post-translational modification of
  the N-terminus or the lysine side chain of peptides and proteins that plays a role
  in the initiation of immune responses, gene expression or epigenetics. Despite its
  high biological relevance, protocols for the chemical N-formylation of synthetic
  peptides are scarce. The few available methods are elaborate in their execution
  and the yields are highly sequence-dependent. We present a rapid, easy-to-use one-pot
  procedure ...
