description: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most common inherited life-threatening
  disorder of lipid metabolism. Early diagnosis and treatment are the key to reduce
  the cumulative life-long cardiovascular burden of patients with FH. The high number
  of LDLR variants described as variants of unknown significance is the largest obstacle
  to achieve a definitive FH diagnosis. This study established a time- and cost-effective
  high-throughput cell-based assay to functionally profile LDLR variants, ...
