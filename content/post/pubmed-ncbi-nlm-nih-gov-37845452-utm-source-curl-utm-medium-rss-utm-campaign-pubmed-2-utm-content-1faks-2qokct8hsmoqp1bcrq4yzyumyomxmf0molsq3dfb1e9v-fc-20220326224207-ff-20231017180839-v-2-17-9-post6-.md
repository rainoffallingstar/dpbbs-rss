description: Cancers are complex, heterogeneous, dynamic and aggressive diseases exhibiting
  a series of characteristic biophysical traits which complement the original biological
  hallmarks of cancers favouring progressive growth, metastasis, and contributing
  to immune evasion and treatment resistance. One of the prevalent differences between
  most solid tumors and their corresponding, healthy tissues is a significantly higher
  water content (hyperhydration) in cancers. As a consequence, cancers have ...
