description: A knowledge gap persists between machine learning (ML) developers (e.g.,
  data scientists) and practitioners (e.g., clinicians), hampering the full utilization
  of ML for clinical data analysis. We investigated the potential of the ChatGPT Advanced
  Data Analysis (ADA), an extension of GPT-4, to bridge this gap and perform ML analyses
  efficiently. Real-world clinical datasets and study details from large trials across
  various medical specialties were presented to ChatGPT ADA without ...
