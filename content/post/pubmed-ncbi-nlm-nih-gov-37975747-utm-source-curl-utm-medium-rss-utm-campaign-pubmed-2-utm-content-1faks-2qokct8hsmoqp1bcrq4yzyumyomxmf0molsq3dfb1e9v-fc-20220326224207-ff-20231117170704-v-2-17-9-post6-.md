description: We have conceived, built, and operated a cryogenic vacuum valve with
  opening and closing times as short as 50 ms that can be used in strong magnetic
  fields and across a broad range of duty cycles. It is used to seal a cryogenic Penning
  trap at liquid-helium temperature for long-term storage of highly charged ions in
  a vacuum better than 10-15 hPa from a room-temperature ion beamline at vacuum conditions
  around 10-9 hPa. It will significantly improve any experiment where a volume at
