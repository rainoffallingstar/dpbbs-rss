  patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver damage is an Ag-independent
  process caused by bystander activation of CD8 T cells and NK cells. How bystander
  lymphocyte activation is initiated in chronic hepatitis B patients remains unclear.
  Periods of liver damage, called hepatic flares, occur unpredictably, making early
