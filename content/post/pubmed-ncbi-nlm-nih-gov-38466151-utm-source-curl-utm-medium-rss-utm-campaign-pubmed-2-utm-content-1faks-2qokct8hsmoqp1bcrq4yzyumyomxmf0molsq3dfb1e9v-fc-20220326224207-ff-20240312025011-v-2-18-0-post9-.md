description: In the past decade, there has been a steady rise in interest in studying
  novel cellular extensions and their potential roles in facilitating human diseases,
  including neurologic diseases, viral infectious diseases, cancer, and others. One
  of the exciting new aspects of this field is improved characterization and understanding
  of the functions and potential mechanisms of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), which are
  actin-based filamentous protrusions that are structurally distinct from filopodia.
