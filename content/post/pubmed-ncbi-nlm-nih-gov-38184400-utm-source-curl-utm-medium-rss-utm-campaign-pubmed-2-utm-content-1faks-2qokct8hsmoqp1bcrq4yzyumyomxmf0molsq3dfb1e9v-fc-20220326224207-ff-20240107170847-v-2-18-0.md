description: Recently, biologists have gained access to several far-field fluorescence
  nanoscopy (FN) technologies that allow the observation of cellular components with
  ~20 nm resolution. FN is revolutionizing cell biology by enabling the visualization
  of previously inaccessible subcellular details. While technological advances in
  microscopy are critical to the field, optimal sample preparation and labeling are
  equally important and often overlooked in FN experiments. In this review, we provide
