description: Ependymomas encompass multiple clinically relevant tumor types based
  on localization and molecular profiles. Tumors of the methylation class "spinal
  ependymoma" (SP-EPN) represent the most common intramedullary neoplasms in children
  and adults. However, their developmental origin is ill-defined, molecular data are
  scarce, and the potential heterogeneity within SP-EPN remains unexplored. The only
  known recurrent genetic events in SP-EPN are loss of chromosome 22q and NF2 mutations,
