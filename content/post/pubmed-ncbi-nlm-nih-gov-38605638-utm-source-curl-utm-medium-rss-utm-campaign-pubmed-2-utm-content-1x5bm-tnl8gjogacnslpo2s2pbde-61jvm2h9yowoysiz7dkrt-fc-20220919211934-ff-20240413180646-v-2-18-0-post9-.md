description: Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing technology have eased analyses
  of signaling networks of cells. Recently, cell-cell interaction has been studied
  based on various link prediction approaches on graph-structured data. These approaches
  have assumptions about the likelihood of node interaction, thus showing high performance
  for only some specific networks. Subgraph-based methods have solved this problem
  and outperformed other approaches by extracting local subgraphs from a given ...
