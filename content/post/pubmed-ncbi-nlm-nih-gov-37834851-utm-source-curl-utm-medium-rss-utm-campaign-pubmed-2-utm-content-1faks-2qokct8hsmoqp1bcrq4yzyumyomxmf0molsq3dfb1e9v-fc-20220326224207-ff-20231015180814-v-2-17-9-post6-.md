description: Free flap reconstruction is the standard of care for extensive defects
  of the head and neck area. In this study, two types of free flaps, the antero-lateral
  thigh flap (ALT) and the vastus lateralis muscle flap, were compared. The primary
  endpoint was flap success, secondary endpoints were complication rates, hospitalization
  and surgery time. Cases with defect situations of the scalp and consecutive microvascular
  free flap reconstructions using either ALT flaps or vastus lateralis muscle ...
