description: Research on microglia in Down syndrome (DS) has shown that microglial
  activation, increased inflammatory gene expression, and oxidative stress occur at
  different ages in DS brains. However, most studies resulted in simplistic definitions
  of microglia as quiescent or active, ignoring potential intermediate states. Indeed,
  recent work on microglial cells in young DS brains indicated that those evolve through
  different intermediate activation phenotypes before reaching a fully activated state.
