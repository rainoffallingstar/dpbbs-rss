description: Older adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) refractory to initial
  or reinduction chemotherapy have a dismal prognosis if they do not undergo hematopoietic
  stem-cell transplantation (HCT). However, data assessing HCT outcomes from different
  donors are scarce. We evaluated results from a retrospective analysis on patients
  aged ≥70 years, with AML not in remission who received an allogeneic HCT from HLA-matched
  sibling donor (MSD), HLA-10/10 matched unrelated donor (MUD), or T-cell ...
