description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common neoplasia and
  the third leading cause of cancer-associated deaths worldwide. Most cases arise
  in patients with cirrhosis, and early detection through periodic screening can make
  it potentially curable. The presence of extrahepatic metastases (EHM) affects treatment
