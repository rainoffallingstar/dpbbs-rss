description: The regulation of protein kinases by dephosphorylation is a key mechanism
  that defines the activity of immune cells. A balanced process of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  of key protein kinases by dual-specificity phosphatases is required for the realization
  of the antitumor immune response. The family of dual-specificity phosphatases is
  represented by several isoforms found in both resting and activated macrophages.
  The main substrate of dual-specificity phosphatases are three ...
