description: Pharmacologic targeting of chromatin-associated protein complexes has
  shown significant responses in KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) but resistance frequently develops to single agents. This points to a need
  for therapeutic combinations that target multiple mechanisms. To enhance our understanding
  of functional dependencies in KMT2A-r AML, we have used a proteomic approach to
  identify the catalytic immunoproteasome subunit PSMB8 as a specific vulnerability.
