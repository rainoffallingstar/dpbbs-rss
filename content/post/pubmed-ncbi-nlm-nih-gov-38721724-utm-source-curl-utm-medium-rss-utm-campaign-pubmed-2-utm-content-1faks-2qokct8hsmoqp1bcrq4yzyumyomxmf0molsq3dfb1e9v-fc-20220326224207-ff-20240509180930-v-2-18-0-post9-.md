description: Immunocompromised patients are at high risk to fail clearance of SARS-CoV-2.
  Prolonged COVID-19 constitutes a health risk and a management problem as cancer
  treatments often have to be disrupted. As SARS-CoV-2 evolves, new variants of concern
  have emerged that evade available monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, antiviral therapy
  promotes SARS-CoV-2 escape mutations, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
  These patients frequently suffer from prolonged infection. No successful treatment
