description: Given the large amount of information that people process daily, it is
  important to understand memory for the truth and falsity of information. The most
  prominent theoretical models in this regard are the Cartesian model and the Spinozan
  model. The former assumes that both "true" and "false" tags may be added to the
  memory representation of encoded information; the latter assumes that only falsity
  is tagged. In the present work, we contrasted these two models with an expectation-violation
