description: Anguillid eel populations are under threat globally. A particularly vulnerable
  life-cycle stage is the migration of mature adult eels downstream from freshwater
  habitats through estuaries into the sea to spawn. This study investigated the factors
  associated with downstream migration of the short-finned eel Anguilla australis
  (Richardson 1841) from a coastal wetland (Lake Condah) in south-east Australia,
  using acoustic telemetry. Migration was associated with time of the year, higher
