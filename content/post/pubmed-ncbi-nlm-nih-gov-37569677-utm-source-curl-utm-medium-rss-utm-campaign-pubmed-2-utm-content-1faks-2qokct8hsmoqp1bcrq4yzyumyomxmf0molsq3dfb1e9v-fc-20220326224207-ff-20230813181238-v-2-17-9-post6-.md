description: Fibrosis is a condition characterized by the excessive accumulation of
  extracellular matrix proteins in tissues, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
  Recent studies have identified EP300, a histone acetyltransferase, as a crucial
  regulator of the epigenetic changes that contribute to fibrosis. In fact, EP300-mediated
  acetylation of histones alters global chromatin structure and gene expression, promoting
  the development and progression of fibrosis. Here, we review the role of ...
