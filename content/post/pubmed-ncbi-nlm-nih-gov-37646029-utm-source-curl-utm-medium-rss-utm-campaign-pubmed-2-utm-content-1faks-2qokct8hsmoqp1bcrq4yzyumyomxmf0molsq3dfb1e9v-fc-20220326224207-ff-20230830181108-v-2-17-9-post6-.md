description: Injuries to our skin trigger a cascade of spatially- and temporally-synchronized
  healing processes. During such endogenous wound repair, the role of fibroblasts
  is multifaceted, ranging from the activation and recruitment of innate immune cells
  through the synthesis and deposition of scar tissue to the conveyor belt-like transport
  of fascial connective tissue into wounds. A comprehensive understanding of fibroblast
  diversity and versatility in the healing machinery may help to decipher ...
