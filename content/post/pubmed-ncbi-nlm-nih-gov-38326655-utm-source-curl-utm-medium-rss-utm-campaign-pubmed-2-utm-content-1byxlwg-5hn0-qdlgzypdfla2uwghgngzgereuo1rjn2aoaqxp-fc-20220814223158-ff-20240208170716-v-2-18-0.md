description: 'CONCLUSION: TMTV-Net demonstrates strong performance and generalizability
  in TMTV segmentation across multi-site external datasets, encompassing various lymphoma
  subtypes. A negligible reduction of 2% in overall performance during testing on
  external data highlights robust model generalizability across different centers
  and cancer types, likely attributable to its training with resampled inputs. Our
  model is publicly available, allowing easy multi-site evaluation and generalizability
  analysis ...'
