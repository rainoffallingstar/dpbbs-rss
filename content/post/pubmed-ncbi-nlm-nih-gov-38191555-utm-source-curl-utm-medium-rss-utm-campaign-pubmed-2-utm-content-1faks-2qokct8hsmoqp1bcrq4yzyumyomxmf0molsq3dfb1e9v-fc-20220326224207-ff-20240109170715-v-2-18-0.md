description: Many genes that drive normal cellular development also contribute to
  oncogenesis. Medulloblastoma (MB) tumors likely arise from neuronal progenitors
  in the cerebellum, and we hypothesized that the heterogeneity observed in MBs with
  sonic hedgehog (SHH) activation could be due to differences in developmental pathways.
  To investigate this question, here we perform single-nucleus RNA sequencing on highly
