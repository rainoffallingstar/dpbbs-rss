description: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been shown to help dermatologists
  diagnose melanoma more accurately, however they lack transparency, hindering user
  acceptance. Explainable AI (XAI) methods can help to increase transparency, yet
  often lack precise, domain-specific explanations. Moreover, the impact of XAI methods
  on dermatologists' decisions has not yet been evaluated. Building upon previous
  research, we introduce an XAI system that provides precise and domain-specific ...
