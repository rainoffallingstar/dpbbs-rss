description: 'A randomized study (acronym: MC-FludT.14/L Trial II) demonstrated that
  fludarabine plus treosulfan (30 g/m²) was an effective and well tolerated conditioning
  regimen for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in older patients
  with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). To further
  evaluate this regimen, all 252 study patients aged 50 to 70 years were compared
  with similar patients, who underwent allo-HCT after fludarabine/melphalan (140 mg/m²)
