description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The AI-based, whole-body calculations of BM metabolism
  via the parameters MTV and TLG not only correlate with the degree of BM plasma cell
  infiltration, but also predict patient survival in MM. In particular, the parameter
  MTV, using the liver uptake as reference for BM segmentation, provides solid prognostic
