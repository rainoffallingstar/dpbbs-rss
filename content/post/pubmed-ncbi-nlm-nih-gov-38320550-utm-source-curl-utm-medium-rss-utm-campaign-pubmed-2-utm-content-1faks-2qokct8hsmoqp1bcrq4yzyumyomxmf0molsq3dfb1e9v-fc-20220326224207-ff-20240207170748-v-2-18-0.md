description: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired at DSB sites. How DSB sites
  assemble and how broken DNA is prevented from separating is not understood. Here
  we uncover that the synapsis of broken DNA is mediated by the DSB sensor protein
  poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Using bottom-up biochemistry, we reconstitute
  functional DSB sites and show that DSB sites form through co-condensation of PARP1
  multimers with DNA. The co-condensates exert mechanical forces to keep DNA ends
