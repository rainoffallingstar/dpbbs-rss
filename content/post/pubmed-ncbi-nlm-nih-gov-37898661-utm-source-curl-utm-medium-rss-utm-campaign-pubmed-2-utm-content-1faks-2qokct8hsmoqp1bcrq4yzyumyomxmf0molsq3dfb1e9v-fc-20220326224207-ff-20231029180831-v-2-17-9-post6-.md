description: Aspirin and its active metabolite salicylate have emerged as promising
  agents for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer (CRC). Moreover, aspirin suppresses
  the progression of established CRCs. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms
  are not completely understood. Here we found that salicylate induces the expression
  of the miR-34a and miR-34b/c genes, which encode tumor suppressive microRNAs, in
  a p53-independent manner. Salicylate activated AMPK, thereby activating NRF2, which
