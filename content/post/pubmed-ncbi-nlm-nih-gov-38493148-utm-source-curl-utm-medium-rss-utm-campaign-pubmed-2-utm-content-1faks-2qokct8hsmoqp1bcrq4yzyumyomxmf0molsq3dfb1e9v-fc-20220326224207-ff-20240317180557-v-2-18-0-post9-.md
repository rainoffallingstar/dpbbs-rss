description: RNA ligases of the RTCB-type play an essential role in tRNA splicing,
  the unfolded protein response and RNA repair. RTCB is the catalytic subunit of the
  pentameric human tRNA ligase complex. RNA ligation by the tRNA ligase complex requires
  GTP-dependent activation of RTCB. This active site guanylylation reaction relies
  on the activation factor Archease. The mechanistic interplay between both proteins
  has remained unknown. Here, we report a biochemical and structural analysis of the
