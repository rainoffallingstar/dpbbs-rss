description: HRD assays are an important element of personalized oncology in ovarian
  carcinomas, but the optimal tissue requirements for these complex molecular assays
  remain unclear. As a result, a considerable percentage of assays are not successful,
  leading to sub-optimal diagnoses for these patients. In this study, we have systematically
  analyzed tumor and tissue parameters for HRD analysis in a large cohort of real-world
  cancer samples. The aim of this study is to give recommendations for ...
