description: Induction of alternative, non-apoptotic cell death programs such as cell-lethal
  autophagy and mitophagy represent possible strategies to combat glioblastoma (GBM).
  Here we report that VLX600, a novel iron chelator and oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) inhibitor, induces a caspase-independent type of cell death that is partially
  rescued in adherent U251 ATG5/7 (autophagy related 5/7) knockout (KO) GBM cells
  and NCH644 ATG5/7 knockdown (KD) glioma stem-like cells (GSCs), suggesting that
