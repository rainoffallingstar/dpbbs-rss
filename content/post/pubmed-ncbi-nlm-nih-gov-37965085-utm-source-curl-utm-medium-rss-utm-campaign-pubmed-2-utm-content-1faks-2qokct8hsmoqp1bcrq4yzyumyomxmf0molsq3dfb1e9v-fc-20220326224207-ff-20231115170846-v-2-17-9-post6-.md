description: 'INTRODUCTION: Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) stands in complex bidirectional
  interaction with the surrounding arteries and is known to be connected to many cardiovascular
  diseases involving vascular inflammation. PCAT texture may be influenced by other
  cardiovascular risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia. The recently established
  photon-counting CT could improve texture analysis and help detect those changes
  by offering higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ...'
