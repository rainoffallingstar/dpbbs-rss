description: The packaging of DNA into chromatin in eukaryotes regulates gene transcription,
  DNA replication and DNA repair. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes (re)arrange
  nucleosomes at the first level of chromatin organization. Their Snf2-type motor
  ATPases alter histone-DNA interactions through a common DNA translocation mechanism.
  Whether remodeller activities mainly catalyse nucleosome dynamics or accurately
  co-determine nucleosome organization remained unclear. In this Review, we discuss
