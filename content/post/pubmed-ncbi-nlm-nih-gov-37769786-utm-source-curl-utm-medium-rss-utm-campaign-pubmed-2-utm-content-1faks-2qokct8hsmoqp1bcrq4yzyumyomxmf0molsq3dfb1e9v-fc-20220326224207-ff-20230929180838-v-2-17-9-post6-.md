description: Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune disorder affecting the small intestine
  with gluten as disease trigger. Infections including Influenza A, increase the CeD
  risk. While gluten-specific CD4^(+) T-cells, recognizing HLA-DQ2/DQ8 presented gluten-peptides,
  initiate and sustain the celiac immune response, CD8^(+) α/β intraepithelial T-cells
  elicit mucosal damage. Here, we subjected TCRs from a cohort of 56 CeD patients
