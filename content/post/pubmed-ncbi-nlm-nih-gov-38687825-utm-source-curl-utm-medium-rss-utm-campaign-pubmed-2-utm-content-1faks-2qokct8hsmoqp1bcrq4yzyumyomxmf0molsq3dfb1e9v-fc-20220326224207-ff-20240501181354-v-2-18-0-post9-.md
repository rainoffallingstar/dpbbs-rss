description: The localization, number, and function of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate
  receptors (AMPARs) are crucial for synaptic plasticity, a cellular correlate for
  learning and memory. The Hippo pathway member WWC1 is an important component of
  AMPAR-containing protein complexes. However, the availability of WWC1 is constrained
  by its interaction with the Hippo pathway kinases LATS1 and LATS2 (LATS1/2). Here,
  we explored the biochemical regulation of this interaction and found that it ...
