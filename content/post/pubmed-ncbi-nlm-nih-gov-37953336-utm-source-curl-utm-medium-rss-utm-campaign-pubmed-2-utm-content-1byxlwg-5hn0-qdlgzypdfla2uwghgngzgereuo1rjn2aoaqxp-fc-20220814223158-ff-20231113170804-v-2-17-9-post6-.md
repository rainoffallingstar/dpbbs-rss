description: Standardized morphological evaluation in pathology is usually qualitative.
  Classifying and qualitatively analyzing the nucleated cells in the bone marrow aspirate
  images based on morphology is crucial for the diagnosis of acute myoid leukemia
  (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), etc.
  However, it is time-consuming and difficult to accurately identify nucleated cells
  and calculate the percentage of the cells because of the complexity of bone ...
