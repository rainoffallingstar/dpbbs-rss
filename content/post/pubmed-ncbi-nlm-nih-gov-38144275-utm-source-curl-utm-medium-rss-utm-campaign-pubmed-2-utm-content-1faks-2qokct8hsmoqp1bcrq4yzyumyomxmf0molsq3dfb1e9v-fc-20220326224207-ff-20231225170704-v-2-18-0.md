description: Epigenetic alteration by oxidative stress is vitally involved in carcinogenesis
  and cancer progression. Previously, we demonstrated that oxidative stress was increased
  in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and associated with tumor aggressiveness.
  Herein, we immunohistochemically investigated whether histone methylation, specifically
  H4K20me3, was upregulated in human hepatic tissues obtained from HCC patients (n
  = 100). Also, we experimentally explored if the H4K20me3 was upregulated ...
