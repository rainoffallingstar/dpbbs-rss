description: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are routinely used in magnetic
  resonance imaging (MRI). They are essential for choosing the most appropriate medical
  or surgical strategy for patients with serious pathologies, particularly in oncologic,
  inflammatory, and cardiovascular diseases. However, GBCAs have been associated with
  an increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with renal failure,
  as well as the possibility of deposition in the brain, bones, and other organs,
