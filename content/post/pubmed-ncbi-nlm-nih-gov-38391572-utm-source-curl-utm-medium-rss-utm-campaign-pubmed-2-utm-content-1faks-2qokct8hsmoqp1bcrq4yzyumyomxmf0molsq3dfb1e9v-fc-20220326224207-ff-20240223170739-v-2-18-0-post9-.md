description: The treatment of fungal bone infections and infected non-unions is a
  huge challenge in modern trauma and orthopedics, which normally contain the local
  and systemic administration of anti-fungal drugs. Although frequently used, little
  is known about the impact of systemic and locally administered fungicides on the
  osteogenic regenerative capabilities of infected bone tissue, especially upon the
  osteogenesis of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-hMSCs). This study
