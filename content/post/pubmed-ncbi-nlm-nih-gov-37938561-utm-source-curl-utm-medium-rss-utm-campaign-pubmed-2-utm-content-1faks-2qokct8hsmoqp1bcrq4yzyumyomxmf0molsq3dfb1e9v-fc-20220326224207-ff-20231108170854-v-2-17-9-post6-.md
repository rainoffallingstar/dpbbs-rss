description: Efficacy of cancer vaccines remains low and mechanistic understanding
  of antigen presenting cell function in cancer may improve vaccine design and outcomes.
  Here, we analyze the transcriptomic and immune-metabolic profiles of Dendritic Cells
  (DCs) from 35 subjects enrolled in a trial of DC vaccines in late-stage melanoma
  (NCT01622933). Multiple platforms identify metabolism as an important biomarker
  of DC function and patient overall survival (OS). We demonstrate multiple immune
