description: Distinguishing between Cushing syndrome (CS) and pseudo Cushing syndrome
  (PCS), also known as physiological hypercortisolism, can be difficult. PCS is caused
  by nonneoplastic overactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and may
  be secondary to a range of conditions, including obesity, physical stress, malnutrition,
  and chronic alcoholism, and typically results in a lesser degree of hypercortisolism
  and fewer clinical features than CS. Management of PCS includes treatment of ...
