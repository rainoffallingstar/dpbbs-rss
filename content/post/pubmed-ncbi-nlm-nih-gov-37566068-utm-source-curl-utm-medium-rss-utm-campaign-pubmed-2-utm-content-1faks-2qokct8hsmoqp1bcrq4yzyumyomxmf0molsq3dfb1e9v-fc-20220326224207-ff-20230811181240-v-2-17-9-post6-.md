description: Vascular smooth muscle voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels have been
  proposed to contribute to myogenic autoregulation. Surprisingly, in initial experiments,
  we observed that the Kv2 channel inhibitor stromatoxin induced vasomotion without
  affecting myogenic tone. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that Kv2 channels contribute
  to myogenic autoregulation by fine-tuning the myogenic response. Expression of Kv2
  channel mRNA was determined using real-time PCR and 'multiplex' single-cell ...
