description: Adolescence is a crucial period for physical and psychological development.
  The impact of negative life events represents a risk factor for the onset of neuropsychiatric
  disorders. This study aims to investigate the relationship between negative life
  events and structural brain connectivity, considering both graph theory and connectivity
  strength. A group (n = 487) of adolescents from the IMAGEN Consortium was divided
  into Low and High Stress groups. Brain networks were extracted at ...
