description: The mustard family (Brassicaceae) is a scientifically and economically
  important family, containing the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and numerous crop
  species that feed billions worldwide. Despite its relevance, most phylogenetic trees
  of the family are incompletely sampled and often contain poorly supported branches.
