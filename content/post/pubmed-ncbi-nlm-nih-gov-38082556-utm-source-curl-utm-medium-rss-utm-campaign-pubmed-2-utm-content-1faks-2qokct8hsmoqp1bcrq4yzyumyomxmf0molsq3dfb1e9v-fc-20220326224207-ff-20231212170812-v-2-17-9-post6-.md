description: The development of bivalent booster vaccines addresses the ongoing evolution
  of the emerging B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant subtypes that are known to escape vaccine-induced
  neutralizing antibody response. Little is known about the immunogenicity and reactogenicity
  of bivalent mRNA vaccines in hemodialysis patients with impaired vaccine response.
  In this prospective, observational cohort study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 anti-S1
  IgG, surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNA), and ...
