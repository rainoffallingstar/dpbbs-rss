description: Olaparib suppresses DNA damage repair by inhibiting the poly ADP ribose
  polymerase (PARP), especially in cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations or the BRCA-ness
  phenotype. However, the first trials showed that some patients with defective DNA
  damage repair are still resistant to olaparib. The recovery of the wildtype BRCA
  is a prominent mechanism of PARP inhibitor (PARPi) resistance in BRCA-deficient
  tumors, but additional molecular features of olaparib resistance remain poorly understood.
