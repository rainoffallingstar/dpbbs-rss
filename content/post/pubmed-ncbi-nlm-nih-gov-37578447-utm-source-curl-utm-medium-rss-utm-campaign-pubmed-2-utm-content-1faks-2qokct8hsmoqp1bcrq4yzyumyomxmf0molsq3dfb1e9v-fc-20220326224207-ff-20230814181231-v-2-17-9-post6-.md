description: Paradoxical heat sensation (PHS) is the perception of warmth when the
  skin is cooled. Paradoxical heat sensation rarely occurs in healthy individuals
  but more frequently in patients suffering from lesions or disease of the peripheral
  or central nervous system. To further understand mechanisms and epidemiology of
  PHS, we evaluated the occurrence of PHS in relation to disease aetiology, pain levels,
  quantitative sensory testing parameters, and Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory
  (NPSI) items ...
