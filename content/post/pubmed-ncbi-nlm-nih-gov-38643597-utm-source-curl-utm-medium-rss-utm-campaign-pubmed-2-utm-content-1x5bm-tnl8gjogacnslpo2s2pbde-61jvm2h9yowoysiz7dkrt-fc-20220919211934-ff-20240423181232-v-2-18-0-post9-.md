description: Great efforts have been made over the years to identify novel drug pairs
  with synergistic effects. Although numerous computational approaches have been proposed
  to analyze diverse types of biological big data, the pharmacogenomic profiles, presumably
  the most direct proxy of drug effects, have been rarely used due to the data sparsity
  problem. In this study, we developed a composite deep-learning-based model that
  predicts the drug synergy effect utilizing pharmacogenomic profiles as well ...
