description: Pharmacological studies established a role for AMPARs in the mammalian
  forebrain in spatial memory performance. Here we generated global GluA1/3 double
  knockout mice (Gria1/3^(-/-)) and conditional knockouts lacking GluA1 and GluA3
  AMPAR subunits specifically from principal cells across the forebrain (Gria1/3^(ΔFb)).
  In both models, loss of GluA1 and GluA3 resulted in reduced hippocampal GluA2 and
  increased levels of the NMDAR subunit GluN2A. Electrically-evoked AMPAR-mediated
  EPSPs were ...
