description: Illuminating associations between diseases and genes can help reveal
  the pathogenesis of syndromes and contribute to treatments, but a large number of
  associations remained unexplored. To identify novel disease-gene associations, many
  computational methods have been developed using disease and gene-related prior knowledge.
  However, these methods remain of relatively inferior performance due to the limited
  external data sources and the inevitable noise among the prior knowledge. In this
  study, ...
