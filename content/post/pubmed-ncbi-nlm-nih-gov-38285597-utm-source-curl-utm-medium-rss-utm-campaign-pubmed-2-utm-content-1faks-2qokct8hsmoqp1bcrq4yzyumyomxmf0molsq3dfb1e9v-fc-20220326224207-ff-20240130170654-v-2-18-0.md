description: This study presents a high-dimensional immunohistochemistry approach
  to assess human γδ T cell subsets in their native tissue microenvironments at spatial
  resolution, a hitherto unmet scientific goal due to the lack of established antibodies
  and required technology. We report an integrated approach based on multiplexed imaging
  and bioinformatic analysis to identify γδ T cells, characterize their phenotypes,
  and analyze the composition of their microenvironment. Twenty-eight γδ T ...
