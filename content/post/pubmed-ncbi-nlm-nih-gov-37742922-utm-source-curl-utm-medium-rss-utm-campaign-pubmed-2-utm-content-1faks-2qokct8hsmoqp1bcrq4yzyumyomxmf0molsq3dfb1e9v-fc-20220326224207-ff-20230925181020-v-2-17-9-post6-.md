description: Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) has significantly advanced the field
  of drug discovery by facilitating proteome-wide identification of drug targets and
  off-targets. However, TPP has not been widely applied for high-throughput drug screenings,
  since the method is labor intensive and requires a lot of measurement time on a
  mass spectrometer. Here, we present Single-tube TPP with Uniform Progression (STPP-UP),
  which significantly reduces both the amount of required input material and ...
