description: Although the safety of phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs) has been continuously
  improved over 70-years of development, high endothelial cell losses can occur even
  with current pIOL models. Numerous studies have demonstrated that the distance of
  a pIOL to the corneal endothelium plays a crucial role in the extent of endothelial
  cell loss. For this reason alone, higher endothelial cell loss tends to be observed
  with anterior chamber lenses than with posterior chamber lenses. Adequate ...
