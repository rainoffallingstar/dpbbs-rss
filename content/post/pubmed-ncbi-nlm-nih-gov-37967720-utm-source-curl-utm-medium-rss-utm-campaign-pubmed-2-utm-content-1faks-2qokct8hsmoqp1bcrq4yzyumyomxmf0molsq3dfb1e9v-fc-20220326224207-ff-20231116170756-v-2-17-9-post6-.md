description: The intestine is home to an intertwined network of epithelial, immune,
  and neuronal cells as well as the microbiome, with implications for immunity, systemic
  metabolism, and behaviour. While the complexity of this microenvironment has long
  since been acknowledged, recent technological advances have propelled our understanding
  to an unprecedented level. Notably, the microbiota and non-immune or structural
  cells have emerged as important conductors of intestinal immunity, and by contrast,
