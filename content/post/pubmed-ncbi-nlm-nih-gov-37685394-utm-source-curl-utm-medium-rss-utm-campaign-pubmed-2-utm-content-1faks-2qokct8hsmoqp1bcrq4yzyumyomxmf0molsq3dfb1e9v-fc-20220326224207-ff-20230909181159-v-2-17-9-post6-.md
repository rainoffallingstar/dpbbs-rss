description: Cataract surgery can lead to inflammatory processes in the retina due
  to its invasive nature, resulting in prolonged recovery times and reduced functional
  outcomes. The aim of the current study is to explore the impact that phacoemulsification
  parameters have on macular thickness following surgery. This prospective single-center
  study enrolled 46 healthy patients (46 eyes) who underwent uneventful cataract surgery.
  Retinal thickness was assessed using optical coherence tomography ...
