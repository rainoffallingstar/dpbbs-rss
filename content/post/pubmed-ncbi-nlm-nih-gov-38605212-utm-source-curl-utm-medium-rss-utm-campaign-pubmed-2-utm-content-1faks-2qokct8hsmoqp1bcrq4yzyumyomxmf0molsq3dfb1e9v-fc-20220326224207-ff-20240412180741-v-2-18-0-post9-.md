description: Protein evolution is constrained by structure and function, creating
  patterns in residue conservation that are routinely exploited to predict structure
  and other features. Similar constraints should affect variation across individuals,
  but it is only with the growth of human population sequencing that this has been
  tested at scale. Now, human population constraint has established applications in
  pathogenicity prediction, but it has not yet been explored for structural inference.
