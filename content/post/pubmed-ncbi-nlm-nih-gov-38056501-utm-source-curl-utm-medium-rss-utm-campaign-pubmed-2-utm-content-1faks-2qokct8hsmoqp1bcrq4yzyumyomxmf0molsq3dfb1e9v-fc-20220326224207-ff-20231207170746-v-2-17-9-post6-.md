description: Surgical navigation, also referred to as computer-assisted or image-guided
  surgery, is a technique that employs a variety of methods - such as 3D imaging,
  tracking systems, specialised software, and robotics to support surgeons during
  surgical interventions. These emerging technologies aim not only to enhance the
  accuracy and precision of surgical procedures, but also to enable less invasive
  approaches, with the objective of reducing complications and improving operative
  outcomes for ...
