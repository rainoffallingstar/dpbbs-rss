description: Immunotherapy using bispecific antibodies including bispecific T-cell
  engager (BiTE) has the potential to enhance the efficacy of treatment for relapsed/refractory
  multiple myeloma. However, myeloma may still recur after treatment due to downregulation
  of a target antigen and/or myeloma cell heterogeneity. To strengthen immunotherapy
  for myeloma while overcoming its characteristics, we have newly developed a BiTE-based
  modality, referred to as Bridging-BiTE (B-BiTE). B-BiTE was able to bind ...
