description: Knowledge of protein function is essential for elucidating disease mechanisms
  and discovering new drug targets. However, there is a widening gap between the exponential
  growth of protein sequences and their limited function annotations. In our prior
  studies, we have developed a series of methods including GraphPPIS, GraphSite, LMetalSite
  and SPROF-GO for protein function annotations at residue or protein level. To further
  enhance their applicability and performance, we now present GPSFun, ...
