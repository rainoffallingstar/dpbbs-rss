description: Higher birth order is associated with altered risk of many disease states.
  Changes in placentation and exposures to in utero growth factors with successive
  pregnancies may impact later life disease risk via persistent DNA methylation alterations.
  We investigated birth order with Illumina DNA methylation array data in each of
  16 birth cohorts (8164 newborns) with European, African, and Latino ancestries from
  the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics Consortium. Meta-analyzed data ...
