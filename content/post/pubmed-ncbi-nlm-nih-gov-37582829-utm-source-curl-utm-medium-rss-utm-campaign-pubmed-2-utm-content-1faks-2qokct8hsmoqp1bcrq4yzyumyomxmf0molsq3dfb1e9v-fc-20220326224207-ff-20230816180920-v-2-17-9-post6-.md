description: Swift diagnosis and treatment play a decisive role in the clinical outcome
  of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
  systems can accelerate the underlying diagnostic processes. Here, we developed an
  artificial neural network (ANN) which allows automated detection of abnormal vessel
  findings without any a-priori restrictions and in <2 minutes. Pseudo-prospective
  external validation was performed in consecutive patients with suspected AIS from
