description: A key question in plant biology is how oriented cell divisions are integrated
  with patterning mechanisms to generate organs with adequate cell type allocation.
  In the root vasculature, a gradient of miRNA165/6 controls the abundance of HD-ZIP
  III transcription factors, which in turn control cell fate and spatially restrict
  vascular cell proliferation to specific cells. Here, we show that vascular development
  requires the presence of ARGONAUTE10, which is thought to sequester miRNA165/6 ...
