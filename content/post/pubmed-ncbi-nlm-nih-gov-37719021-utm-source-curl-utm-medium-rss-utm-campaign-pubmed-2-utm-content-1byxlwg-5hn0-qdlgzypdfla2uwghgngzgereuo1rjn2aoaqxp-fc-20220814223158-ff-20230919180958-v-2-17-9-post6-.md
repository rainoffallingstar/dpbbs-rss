description: Analyzing gene expression profiles (GEP) through artificial intelligence
  provides meaningful insight into cancer disease. This study introduces DeepSHAP
  Autoencoder Filter for Genes Selection (DSAF-GS), a novel deep learning and explainable
  artificial intelligence-based approach for feature selection in genomics-scale data.
  DSAF-GS exploits the autoencoder's reconstruction capabilities without changing
  the original feature space, enhancing the interpretation of the results. ...
