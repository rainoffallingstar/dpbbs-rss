description: Carbonate geothermometry is a fundamental tool for quantitative assessment
  of the geothermal and geochemical evolution of diagenetic and hydrothermal systems,
  but it remains difficult to obtain accurate and precise formation temperatures of
  low-temperature calcite samples (below ~ 40 to 60 °C). Here, we apply three geothermometry
  methods (∆(47)-thermometry, nucleation-assisted fluid inclusion microthermometry-hereafter
  NA-FIM-and oxygen isotope thermometry) to slow-growing subaqueous ...
