description: Targeting greater pump flow and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during cardiopulmonary
  bypass (CPB) could potentially alleviate renal hypoxia and reduce the risk of postoperative
  acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, in an observational study of 93 patients undergoing
  on-pump cardiac surgery, we tested whether intraoperative hemodynamic management
  differed between patients who did and did not develop AKI. Then, in 20 patients,
  we assessed the feasibility of a larger-scale trial in which ...
