description: Natural Killer (NK) cells have high intrinsic cytotoxic capacity, and
  clinical trials have demonstrated their safety and efficacy for adoptive cancer
  therapy. Expression of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) enhances NK cell target-specificity,
  with these cells applicable as 'off-the-shelf' products generated from allogeneic
  donors. Here, we present for the first time an innovative approach for CAR NK cell
  engineering employing a non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon/transposase-based
