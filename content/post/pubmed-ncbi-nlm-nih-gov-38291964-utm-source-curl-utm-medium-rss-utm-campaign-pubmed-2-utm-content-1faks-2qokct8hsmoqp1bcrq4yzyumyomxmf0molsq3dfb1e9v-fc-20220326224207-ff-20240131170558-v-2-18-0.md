description: Bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) proteins and histone deacetylases
  (HDACs) are prime targets in cancer therapy. Recent research has particularly focused
  on the development of dual BET/HDAC inhibitors for hard-to-treat tumors, such as
  pancreatic cancer. Here, we developed a new series of potent dual BET/HDAC inhibitors
  by choosing starting scaffolds that enabled us to optimally merge the two functionalities
  into a single compound. Systematic structure-guided modification of ...
