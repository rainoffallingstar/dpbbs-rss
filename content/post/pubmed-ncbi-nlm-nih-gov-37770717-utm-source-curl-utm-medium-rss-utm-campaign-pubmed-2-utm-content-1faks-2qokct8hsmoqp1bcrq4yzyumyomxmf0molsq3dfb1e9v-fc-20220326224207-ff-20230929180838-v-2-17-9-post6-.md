description: To understand how the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex
  regulates enhancers and enhancer-promoter interactions, we have developed an approach
  to segment and extract key biophysical parameters from live-cell three-dimensional
  single-molecule trajectories. Unexpectedly, this has revealed that NuRD binds to
  chromatin for minutes, decompacts chromatin structure and increases enhancer dynamics.
  We also uncovered a rare fast-diffusing state of enhancers and found that NuRD ...
