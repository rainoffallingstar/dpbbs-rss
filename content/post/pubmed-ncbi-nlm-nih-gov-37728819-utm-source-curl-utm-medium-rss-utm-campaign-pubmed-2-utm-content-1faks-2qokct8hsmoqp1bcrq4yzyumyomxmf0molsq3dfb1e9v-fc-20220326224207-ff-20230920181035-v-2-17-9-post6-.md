description: Central nervous system (CNS) radiotoxicity remains a challenge in neuro-oncology.
  Dose distribution advantages of protons over photons have prompted increased use
  of brain-directed proton therapy. While well-recognized among pediatric populations,
  the benefit of proton therapy among adults with CNS malignancies remains controversial.
  We herein discuss the role of protons in mitigating late CNS radiotoxicities in
  adult patients. Despite limited clinical trials, evidence suggests toxicity ...
