description: The mammary gland is a dynamic organ with various physiological processes
  like cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during the pregnancy-lactation-involution
  cycle. It is essential to understand the molecular changes during the lactogenic
  differentiation of mammary epithelial cells (MECs, the milk-synthesizing cells).
  The MECs are organized as luminal milk-secreting cells and basal myoepithelial cells
  (responsible for milk ejection by contraction) that form the alveoli. ...
