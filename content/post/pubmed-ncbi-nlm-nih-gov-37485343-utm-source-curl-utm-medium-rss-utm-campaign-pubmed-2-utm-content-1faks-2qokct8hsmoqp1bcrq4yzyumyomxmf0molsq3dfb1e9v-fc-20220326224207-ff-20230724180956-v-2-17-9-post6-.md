description: 'Objective: Most methods to detect copy number variation (CNV) have high
  false positive rates, especially for small CNVs and in real-life samples from clinical
  studies. In this study, we explored a novel scatterplot-based method to detect CNVs
  in microarray samples. Methods: Illumina SNP microarray data from 13,254 individuals
  were analyzed with scatterplots and by PennCNV. The data were analyzed without the
  prior exclusion of low-quality samples. For CNV scatterplot visualization, the ...'
