description: Increasing evidence suggests that the beta genus of human papillomavirus
  (β-HPV) cooperates with ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation in inducing non-melanoma skin
  cancer (NMSC). For instance, expression of E6 and E7 oncoproteins from cutaneous
  human papillomavirus type 38 (HPV38) in a transgenic mouse model (Tg38) leads to
  the development of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after chronic UVB exposure. Transcriptomic
  analysis of the Tg38 SCC samples revealed a deregulation of inflammasome ...
