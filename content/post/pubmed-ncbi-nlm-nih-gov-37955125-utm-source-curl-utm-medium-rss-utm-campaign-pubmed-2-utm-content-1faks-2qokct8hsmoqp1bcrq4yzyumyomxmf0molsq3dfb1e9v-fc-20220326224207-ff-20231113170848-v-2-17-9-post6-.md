description: We addressed if hyperfiltration can be assessed transcutaneously in male
  diabetic obese mice (BTBR^(ob/ob)) at 12 and 24 weeks and how this relates to glomerular
  parameters indicative for hyperfiltration. Transcutaneous assessment of FITC-Sinistrin
  clearance (tGFR) was compared against classical plasma clearance. Kidney from SV620C-01-PEI
  perfused mice were harvested at 24 weeks and processed for tissue clearing and classical
  histology. Perfusion patterns of glomerular capillaries, ...
