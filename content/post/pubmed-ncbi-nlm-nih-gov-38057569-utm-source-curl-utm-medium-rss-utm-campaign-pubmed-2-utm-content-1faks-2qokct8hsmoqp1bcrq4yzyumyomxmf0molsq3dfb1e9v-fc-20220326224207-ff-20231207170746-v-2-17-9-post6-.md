description: Galactic outflows are believed to play a critical role in the evolution
  of galaxies by regulating their mass build-up and star formation¹. Theoretical models
  assume bipolar shapes for the outflows that extend well into the circumgalactic
  medium (CGM), up to tens of kiloparsecs (kpc) perpendicular to the galaxies. They
  have been directly observed in the local Universe in several individual galaxies,
  for example, around the Milky Way and M82 (refs. ^(2,3)). At higher redshifts, ...
