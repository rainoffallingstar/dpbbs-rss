description: Persisting alloreactive donor T cells in target tissues are a determinant
  of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but the transcriptional regulators that control
  the persistence and function of tissue-infiltrating T cells remain elusive. We demonstrate
  here that Id3, a DNA-binding inhibitor, is critical for sustaining T cell responses
  in GVHD target tissues in mice, including the liver and intestine. Id3 loss results
  in aberrantly expressed PD-1 in polyfunctional Th1 cells, ...
