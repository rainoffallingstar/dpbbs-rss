description: Adolescent subcortical structural brain development might underlie psychopathological
  symptoms, which often emerge in adolescence. At the same time, sex differences exist
  in psychopathology, which might be mirrored in underlying sex differences in structural
  development. However, previous studies showed inconsistencies in subcortical trajectories
  and potential sex differences. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the subcortical
  structural trajectories and their sex differences across ...
