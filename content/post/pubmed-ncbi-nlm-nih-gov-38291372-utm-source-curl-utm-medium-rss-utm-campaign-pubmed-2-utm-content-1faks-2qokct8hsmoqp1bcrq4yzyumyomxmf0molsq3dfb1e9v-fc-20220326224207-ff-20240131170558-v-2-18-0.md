description: 'BACKGROUND: Pediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) is essentially a single
  pathway disease, with most tumors driven by genomic alterations affecting the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/ERK (MAPK) pathway, predominantly KIAA1549::BRAF fusions and BRAF
  V600E mutations. This makes pLGG an ideal candidate for MAPK pathway-targeted treatments.
  The type I BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib, in combination with the MEK inhibitor, trametinib,
  has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ...'
