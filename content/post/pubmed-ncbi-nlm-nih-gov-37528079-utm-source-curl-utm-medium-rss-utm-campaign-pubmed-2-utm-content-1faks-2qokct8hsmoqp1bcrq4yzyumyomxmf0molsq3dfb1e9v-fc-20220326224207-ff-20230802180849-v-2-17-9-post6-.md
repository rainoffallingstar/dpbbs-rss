description: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, which likely enabled the evolution
  of life by keeping the early Earth warm. Here, we demonstrate routes towards abiotic
  methane and ethane formation under early-earth conditions from methylated sulfur
  and nitrogen compounds with prebiotic origin. These compounds are demethylated in
  Fenton reactions governed by ferrous iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced
  by light and heat in aqueous environments. After the emergence of life, this phenomenon
