description: Mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (MLA) of the female genital tract is
  an uncommon histotype that can arise in both the endometrium and the ovary. The
  exact cell of origin and histogenesis currently remain unknown. Here, we investigated
  whole genome DNA methylation patterns and copy number variations (CNVs) in a series
  of MLAs in the context of a large cohort of various gynaecological carcinoma types.
  CNV analysis of 19 MLAs uncovered gains of chromosomes 1q (18/19, 95%), 10 (15/19,
  79%), ...
