description: Moroccan wetlands host up to half a million wintering birds and provide
  a stopover for tens of thousands of migrants, while they are inhabited by few nesting
  species. Most of this avifauna prefers to use the large coastal wetlands or reservoirs,
  while many species are dispersed across hundreds of small inland wetlands of various
  types. In this study, we monitored the wintering avifauna of 11 wetlands of the
  Saïss plain and its adjacent Atlas Mountains (north-center of Morocco), during ...
