description: The accumulation of somatic mutations is a driver of cancer and has long
  been associated with ageing. Due to limitations in quantifying mutation burden with
  age in non-cancerous tissues, the impact of somatic mutations in other ageing phenotypes
  is unclear. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies have allowed the large-scale
  quantification of somatic mutations in ageing tissues. These studies have revealed
  a gradual accumulation of mutations in most normal tissues with age as well as ...
