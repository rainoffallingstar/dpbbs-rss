description: Leukocytes, also called White Blood Cells (WBCs) or leucocytes, are the
  cells that play a pivotal role in human health and are vital indicators of diseases
  such as malaria, leukemia, AIDS, and other viral infections. WBCs detection and
  classification in blood smears offers insights to pathologists, aiding diagnosis
  across medical conditions. Traditional techniques, including manual counting, detection,
  classification, and visual inspection of microscopic images by medical professionals,
