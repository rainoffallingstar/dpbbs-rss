description: Searches for the rare hadronic decays B^{0}→pp[over ¯]pp[over ¯] and
  B_{s}^{0}→pp[over ¯]pp[over ¯] are performed using proton-proton collision data
  recorded by the LHCb experiment and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
  9 fb^{-1}. Significances of 9.3σ and 4.0σ, including statistical and systematic
  uncertainties, are obtained for the B^{0}→pp[over ¯]pp[over ¯] and B_{s}^{0}→pp[over
  ¯]pp[over ¯] signals, respectively. The branching fractions are measured relative
  to the ...
