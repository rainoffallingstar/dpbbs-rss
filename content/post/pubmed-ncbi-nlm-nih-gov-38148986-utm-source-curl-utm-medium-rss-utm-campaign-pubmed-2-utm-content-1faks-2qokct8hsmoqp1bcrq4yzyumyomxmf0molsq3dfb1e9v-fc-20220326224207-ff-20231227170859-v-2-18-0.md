description: Immunofluorescence microscopy is a widely adopted method for studying
  meiotic prophase in the nematode model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans . An in-depth
  examination of specific meiotic processes requires the quantitative analysis of
  immunofluorescence images, which often involves the segmentation of individual cells
  or nuclei. Here, we introduce our image analysis pipeline to automate significant
  portions of this task. This pipeline relies on the powerful deep learning model
  Cellpose 2.0 ...
