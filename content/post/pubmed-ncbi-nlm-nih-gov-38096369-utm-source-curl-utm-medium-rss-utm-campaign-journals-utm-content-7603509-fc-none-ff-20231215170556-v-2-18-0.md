description: Extreme disease phenotypes can provide key insights into the pathophysiology
  of common conditions, but studying these patients is challenging due to their rarity
  and the limited statistical power of existing methods. Herein, we used a novel approach
  to pathway-based mutational burden testing, the rare variant trend test (RVTT),
  to investigate genetic risk factors for an extreme form of sepsis-induced coagulopathy,
  infectious purpura fulminans (PF). In addition to prospective patient ...
