description: Recent evidence suggests that some human cancers may harbor low-biomass
  microbial ecosystems, spanning bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Bacteria, the most-studied
  kingdom in this context, are suggested by these studies to localize within cancer
  cells, immune cells and other tumor microenvironment cell types, where they are
  postulated to impact multiple cancer-related functions. Herein, we provide an overview
