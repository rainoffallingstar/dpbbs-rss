description: Although several promising approaches for the treatment of relapsed/refractory
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (rrDLBCL) have been approved recently, it remains
  unclear which patients will ultimately achieve long-term responses. Circulating
  tumor (ct)DNA sequencing has emerged as a valuable tool to assess minimal residual
  disease (MRD). Correlations between MRD and outcomes have been shown in previously
  untreated DLBCL, but data on the repeated assessment of MRD in the dynamic course
  of rrDLBCL ...
