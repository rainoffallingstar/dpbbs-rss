description: The identification of patient-derived, tumor-reactive T cell receptors
  (TCRs) as a basis for personalized transgenic T cell therapies remains a time- and
  cost-intensive endeavor. Current approaches to identify tumor-reactive TCRs analyze
  tumor mutations to predict T cell activating (neo)antigens and use these to either

  for transgenic autologous therapies. Here we combined high-throughput TCR cloning
