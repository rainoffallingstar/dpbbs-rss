description: Although gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths,
  systemic treatment strategies remain scarce. Here, we report the pro-tumorigenic
  properties of the crosstalk between intestinal tuft cells and type 2 innate lymphoid
  cells (ILC2) that is evolutionarily optimized for epithelial remodeling in response
  to helminth infection. We demonstrate that tuft cell-derived interleukin 25 (IL25)
  drives ILC2 activation, inducing the release of IL13 and promoting epithelial tuft
