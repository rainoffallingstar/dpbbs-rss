description: Immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) has greatly improved the survival of
  cancer patients in the past few years, but only a small number of patients respond
  to ICT. To predict ICT response, we developed a multi-modal feature fusion model
  based on deep learning (MFMDL). This model utilizes graph neural networks to map
  gene-gene relationships in gene networks to low dimensional vector spaces, and then
  fuses biological pathway features and immune cell infiltration features to make
  robust predictions ...
