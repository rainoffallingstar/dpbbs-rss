  in response to hydrodynamic forces. We previously showed that high shear promoted
  self-association of VWF into hyperadhesive strands, which can be attenuated by high
  density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein(apo) A-I. Here, we show that low density
  lipoprotein (LDL) binds VWF under shear and enhances self-association. Vortexing
