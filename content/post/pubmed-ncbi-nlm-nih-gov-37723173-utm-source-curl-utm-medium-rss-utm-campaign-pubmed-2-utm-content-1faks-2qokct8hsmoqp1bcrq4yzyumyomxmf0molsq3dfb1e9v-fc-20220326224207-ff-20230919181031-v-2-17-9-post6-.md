description: To determine whether Xpert bladder cancer monitor, a noninvasive PCR-based
  biomarker test, can predict the need for 2nd transurethral resection of the bladder
  (TURB) better than clinical assessment. Patients scheduled for TURB were prospectively
  screened. After initial TURB, patients were assigned to 2nd TURB or follow-up cystoscopy
  at 3 months (FU) by clinicians' discretion. Central urine cytology and Xpert monitor
  tests were performed prior to the 1st TURB and 2nd TURB or FU, ...
