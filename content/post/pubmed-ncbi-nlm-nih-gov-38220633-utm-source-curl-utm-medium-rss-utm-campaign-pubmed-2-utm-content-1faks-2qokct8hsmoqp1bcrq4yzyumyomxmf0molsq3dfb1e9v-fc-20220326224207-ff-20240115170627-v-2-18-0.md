description: In the frame of our investigations on the systematics of the complex
  of species of Trimeresurus albolabris, we came across specimens from Myanmar variously
  referred to as Trimeresurus albolabris Gray, 1842 or T. septentrionalis Kramer,
  1977 in the literature. We describe a new species of green pitviper of the genus
  Trimeresurus Lacpde, 1804 from central and southern Myanmar based on molecular analyses
  drawn from previously published phylogenies and new morphological data. This new
