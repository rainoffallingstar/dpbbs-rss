description: In this study, we provide a comprehensive clinical and molecular biological
  characterization of radiation-induced gliomas (RIG), including a risk assessment
  for developing gliomas. A cohort of 12 patients who developed RIG 9.5 years (3-31
  years) after previous cranial radiotherapy for brain tumors or T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia was established. The derived risk of RIG development based on our consecutive
  cohort of 371 irradiated patients was 1.6% at 10 years and 3.02% at 15 ...
