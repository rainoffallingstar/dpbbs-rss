description: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor with a strong
  tendency to metastasize, limiting the prognosis of affected patients. Genomic, epigenomic
  and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated the exquisite molecular complexity
  of this tumor, but have not sufficiently defined the underlying mechanisms or identified
  promising therapeutic targets. To systematically explore RNA-protein interactions
  relevant to OS, we define the RNA interactomes together with the full proteome ...
