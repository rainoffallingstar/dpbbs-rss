description: Monoclonal antibodies, such as PD-1 inhibitors, are increasingly used
  in various cancers. Acute low back pain as infusion-related reaction (IRR) to monoclonal
  antibodies is poorly described. We report a bicentric series of 10 cases of acute
  low back pain due to administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against PD-1/PD-L1
  for skin cancer treatment in patients treated at University Hospital Heidelberg
  and University Medical Center Mainz (Germany). The management of IRR symptoms ...
