description: Deleterious germline RUNX1 variants cause the autosomal dominant disease
  familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM), characterized
  by thrombocytopenia, platelet functional defects and predisposition to hematologic
  malignancies (HMs). We launched a FPDMM natural history study and, from January
  2019-December 2021, enrolled 214 participants, including 111 patients with 39 different
  RUNX1 variants from 45 unrelated families. Of those with available data, 91% (70/77)
