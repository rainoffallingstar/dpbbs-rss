description: The Mitochondrial Complex I Assembly (MCIA) complex is essential for
  the biogenesis of respiratory Complex I (CI), the first enzyme in the respiratory
  chain, which has been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. However,
  how MCIA facilitates CI assembly, and how it is linked with AD pathogenesis, is
  poorly understood. Here we report the structural basis of the complex formation
  between the MCIA subunits ECSIT and ACAD9. ECSIT binding induces a major conformational
  change in ...
