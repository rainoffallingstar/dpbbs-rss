description: Acoustophoretic forces have been successfully implemented into droplet-based
  microfluidic devices to manipulate droplets. These acoustophoretic forces in droplet
  microfluidic devices are typically generated as in acoustofluidic devices through
  transducer actuation of a piezoelectric substrate such as lithium niobate (LiNbO(3)),
  which is inherently accompanied by the emergence of electrical fields. Understanding
  acoustophoretic versus dielectrophoretic forces produced by electrodes ...
