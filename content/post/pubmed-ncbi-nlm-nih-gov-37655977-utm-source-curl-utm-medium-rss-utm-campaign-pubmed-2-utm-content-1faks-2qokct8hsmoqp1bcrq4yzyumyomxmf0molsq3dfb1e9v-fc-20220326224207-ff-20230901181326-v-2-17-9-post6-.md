description: Chronic implant-related bone infections are a severe complication in
  orthopaedic surgery. Biofilm formation on the implant impairs the immune response,
  leading to bacterial persistence. In a previous study, we found that Staphylococcus
  aureus (SA) induced interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) activation and Ifnb expression
  only in its planktonic form but not in the biofilm. The aim of this study was to
  clarify the role of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in this process.
