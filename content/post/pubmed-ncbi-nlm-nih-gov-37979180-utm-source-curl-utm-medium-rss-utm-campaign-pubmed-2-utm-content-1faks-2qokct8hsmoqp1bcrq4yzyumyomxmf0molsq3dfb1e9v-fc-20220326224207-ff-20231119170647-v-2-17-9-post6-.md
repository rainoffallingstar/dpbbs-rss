description: A critical virus-encoded regulator of HIV-1 transcription is the Tat
  protein, which is required to potently activate transcription. Tat is regulated
  by a wide variety of post-translational modifications. This protocol describes an
  in vitro assay to study Tat methylation. We describe steps for incorporation of
  radioactive methyl groups into Tat protein, visualization by gel analysis, Coomassie
  blue stain, gel drying, and detection by autoradiography. This protocol can also
  be used to ...
