description: Accelerated SuFEx Click Chemistry (ASCC) is a powerful method for coupling
  aryl and alkyl alcohols with SuFEx-compatible functional groups. With its hallmark
  favorable kinetics and exceptional product yields, ASCC streamlines the synthetic
  workflow, simplifies the purification process, and is ideally suited for discovering
  functional molecules. We showcase the versatility and practicality of the ASCC reaction
  as a tool for the late-stage derivatization of bioactive molecules and in the ...
