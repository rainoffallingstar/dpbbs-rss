description: Hyperglycaemia is critical for initiation of diabetic vascular complications.
  We systemically addressed the role of hyperglycaemia in the regulation of TLRs in
  primary human macrophages. Expression of TLRs (1-9) was examined in monocyte-derived
  M(NC), M(IFNγ) and M(IL4) differentiated in normoglycemic and hyperglycaemic conditions.
  Hyperglycaemia increased expression of TLR1 and TLR8 in M(NC), TLR 2 and 6 in M(IFNγ),
  and TLR4 and TLR5 in M(IL4). The strongest effect of hyperglycaemia in ...
