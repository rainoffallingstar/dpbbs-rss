description: The first observation and study of two new baryonic structures in the
  final state Ξ_{b}^{0}π^{+}π^{-} and the confirmation of the Ξ_{b}(6100)^{-} state
  in the Ξ_{b}^{-}π^{+}π^{-} decay mode are reported using proton-proton collision
  data collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity
  of 9 fb^{-1}. In addition, the properties of the known Ξ_{b}^{*0}, Ξ_{b}^{'-} and
  Ξ_{b}^{*-} resonances are measured with improved precision. The new decay mode of
  the Ξ_{b}^{0} ...
