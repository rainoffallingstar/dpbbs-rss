description: The production rate of Λ_{b}^{0} baryons relative to B^{0} mesons in
  pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy sqrt[s]=13 TeV is measured by the LHCb
  experiment. The ratio of Λ_{b}^{0} to B^{0} production cross sections shows a significant
  dependence on both the transverse momentum and the measured charged-particle multiplicity.
  At low multiplicity, the ratio measured at LHCb is consistent with the value measured
  in e^{+}e^{-} collisions, and increases by a factor of ∼2 with ...
