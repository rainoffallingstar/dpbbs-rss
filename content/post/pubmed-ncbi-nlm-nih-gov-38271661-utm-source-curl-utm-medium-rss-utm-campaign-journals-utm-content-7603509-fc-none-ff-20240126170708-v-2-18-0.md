description: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an essential contributor to microvascular
  thrombosis. Physiological cleavage by ADAMTS13 limits its prothrombotic properties,
  explaining why ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to attacks of microthrombosis in patients
  with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). We previously reported that plasminogen
  activation takes place during TTP attacks in these patients. Furthermore, stimulation
  of plasminogen activation attenuates pathogenesis in preclinical TTP models in ...
