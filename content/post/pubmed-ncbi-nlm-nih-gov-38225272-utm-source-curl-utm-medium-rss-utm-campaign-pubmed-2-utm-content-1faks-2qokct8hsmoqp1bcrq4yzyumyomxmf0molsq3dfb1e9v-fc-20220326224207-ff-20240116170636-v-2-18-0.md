description: There are epidemiological associations between obesity and type 2 diabetes,
  cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. The role of amyloid beta 42 (Aβ(42))
  in these diverse chronic diseases is obscure. Here we show that adipose tissue releases
  Aβ(42), which is increased from adipose tissue of male mice with obesity and is
  associated with higher plasma Aβ(42). Increasing circulating Aβ(42) levels in male
  mice without obesity has no effect on systemic glucose homeostasis but has ...
