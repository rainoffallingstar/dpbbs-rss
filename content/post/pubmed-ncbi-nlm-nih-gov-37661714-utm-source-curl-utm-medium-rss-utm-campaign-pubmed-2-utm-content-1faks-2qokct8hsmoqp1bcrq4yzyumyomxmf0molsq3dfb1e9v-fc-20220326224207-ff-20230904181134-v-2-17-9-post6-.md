description: Restraint stress (RS) can induce male reproductive deficits by activating
  the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and causing oxidative stress. Previous
  studies have shown that probiotics can alleviate neurological and metabolic disorders
  induced by stress. However, the effects of probiotics on RS-induced reproductive
  deficits have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate whether
