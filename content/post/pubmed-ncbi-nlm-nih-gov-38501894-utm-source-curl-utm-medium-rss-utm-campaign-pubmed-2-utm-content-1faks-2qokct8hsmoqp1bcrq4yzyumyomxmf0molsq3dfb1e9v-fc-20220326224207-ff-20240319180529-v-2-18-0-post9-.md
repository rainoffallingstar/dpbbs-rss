description: We demonstrate an optimized oligonucleotide library-based approach for
  the identification of virus-reactive T-cell receptors using Epstein-Barr virus as
  an example. HEK293T served as antigen-presenting cells and were co-cultured with
  human T cells that were transduced with T-cell receptors in question. T-cell activation
  was detected by CD137 ...
