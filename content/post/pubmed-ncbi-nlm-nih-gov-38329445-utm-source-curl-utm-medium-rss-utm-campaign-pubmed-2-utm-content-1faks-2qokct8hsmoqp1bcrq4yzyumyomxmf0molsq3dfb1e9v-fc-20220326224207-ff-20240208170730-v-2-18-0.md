description: The present Comment demonstrates important flaws of the paper Opodi et
  al. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2022, 24, 11958 Their crown result ("applicability
  map") aims at indicating parameter ranges wherein two approximate methods (called
  method 2 and 3) apply. My calculations reveal that the applicability map is a factual
  error. Deviations of I(2) from the exact current I(1) do not exceed 3% for model
  parameters where Opodi et al. claimed that method 2 is inapplicable. As for method
  3, the ...
