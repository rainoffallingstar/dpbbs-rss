description: Organic and inorganic volatile compounds containing one carbon atom (C(1)),
  such as carbon dioxide, methane, methanol, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and chloromethane,
  are ubiquitous in the environment, are key components in global carbon cycling,
  play an important role in atmospheric physics and chemistry, e.g., as greenhouse
  gases, destroy stratospheric and tropospheric ozone, and control the atmospheric
  oxidation capacity. Up to now, most C(1) compounds in the environment were ...
