description: Previous studies have described the association of onchocerciasis (caused
  by Onchocerca volvulus) with epilepsy, including nodding syndrome, although a clear
  etiological link is still missing. Cases are found in different African countries
  (Tanzania, South Sudan, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African
  Republic and Cameroon). In our study we investigated immunological parameters (cytokine,
  chemokine, immunoglobulin levels) in individuals from the Mahenge area, ...
