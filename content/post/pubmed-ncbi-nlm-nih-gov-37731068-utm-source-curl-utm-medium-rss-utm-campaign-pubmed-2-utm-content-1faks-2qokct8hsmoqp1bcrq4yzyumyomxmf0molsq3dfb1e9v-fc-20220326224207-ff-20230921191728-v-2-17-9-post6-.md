description: The co-administration of venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, with a mould-active
  azole, such a posaconazole, has potential to both prevent invasive fungal infection
  (IFI) and reduce the required treatment dose, and cost, of venetoclax. Posaconazole
  drug-level monitoring is critical to ensuring adequate mould prophylaxis. A retrospective
  audit of 99 patients at a tertiary cancer centre, with myeloid malignancies co-prescribed
  venetoclax and posaconazole between January 2018 and April 2022, ...
