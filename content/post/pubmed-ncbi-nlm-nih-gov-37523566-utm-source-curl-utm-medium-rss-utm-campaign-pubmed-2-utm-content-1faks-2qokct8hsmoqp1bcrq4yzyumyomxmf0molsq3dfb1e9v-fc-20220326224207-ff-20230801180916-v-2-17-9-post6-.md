description: Drosophila Smaug and its orthologs comprise a family of mRNA repressor
  proteins that exhibit various functions during animal development. Smaug proteins
  contain a characteristic RNA-binding sterile-α motif (SAM) domain and a conserved
  but uncharacterized N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we resolved the crystal structure
  of the NTD of the human SAM domain-containing protein 4A (SAMD4A, a.k.a. Smaug1)
  to 1.6 Å resolution, which revealed its composition of a homodimerization D subdomain
  and ...
