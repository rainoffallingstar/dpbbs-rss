description: Incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing globally. Radioembolization
  (RE)/selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) is a promising treatment for inoperable
  HCC. RE triggers an immune response, involving extracellular vesicles (EVs) which
  are crucial for cell communication and tumor development. This study explores EV
  immune profiles and origins in patients with inoperable HCC before and after SIRT/RE.
  Blood samples from 50 HCC-patients treated with SIRT/RE were collected before ...
