description: Epigenetic alterations, including aberrant DNA methylation, are now recognized
  as bone fide hallmarks of cancer, which can contribute to cancer initiation, progression,
  therapy responses and therapy resistance. Methylation of gene promoters can have
  a range of impacts on cancer risk, clinical stratification and therapeutic outcomes.
  We provide several important examples of genes, which can be silenced or activated
  by promoter methylation and highlight their clinical implications. These ...
