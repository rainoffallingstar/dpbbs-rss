description: Two quantum systems, each described as a random-matrix ensemble, are
  coupled to each other via a number of transition states. Each system is strongly
  coupled to a large number of channels. The average transmission probability is the
  product of three factors describing, respectively, formation of the first system
  from the entrance channel, decay of the second system through the exit channel,
  and transport through the transition states. Each of the transition states contributes
