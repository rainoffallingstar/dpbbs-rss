description: This chapter explores the multifaceted roles of DNA-PK with particular
  focus on its functions in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. DNA-PK is
  the primary orchestrator of NHEJ but also regulates other biologic processes. The
  growing understanding of varied DNA-PK biologic roles highlights new avenues for
  cancer treatment. However, these multiple roles also imply challenges, particularly
  in combination therapies, with perhaps a higher risk of clinical toxicities than
