description: Crohn disease (CD) burden has increased with globalization/urbanization,
  and the rapid rise is attributed to environmental changes rather than genetic drift.
  The Study Of Urban and Rural CD Evolution (SOURCE, n = 380) has considered diet-omics
  domains simultaneously to detect complex interactions and identify potential beneficial
  and pathogenic factors linked with rural-urban transition and CD. We characterize
  exposures, diet, ileal transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiome in ...
