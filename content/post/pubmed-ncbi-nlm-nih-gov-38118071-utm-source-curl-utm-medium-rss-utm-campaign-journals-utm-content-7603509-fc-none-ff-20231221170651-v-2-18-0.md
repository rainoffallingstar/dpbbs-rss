description: Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme in glycolysis, the sole source of
  ATP, which is essential for all energy-dependent activities of red blood cells.
  Activating PK shows great potential for treating a broad range of hemolytic anemias
  beyond PK deficiency, as they also enhance activity of wild-type PK. Motivated by
  observations of sickle cell complications in sickle trait individuals with concomitant
  PK deficiency, activating endogenous PK offers a novel and promising approach for
