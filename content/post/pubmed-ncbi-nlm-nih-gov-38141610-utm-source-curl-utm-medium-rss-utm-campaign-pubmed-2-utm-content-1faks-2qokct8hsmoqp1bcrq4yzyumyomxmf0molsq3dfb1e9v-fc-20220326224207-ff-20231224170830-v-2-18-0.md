description: Tissue factor (TF), which is a member of the cytokine receptor family,
  promotes coagulation and coagulation-dependent inflammation. TF also exerts protective
  effects through unknown mechanisms. Here, we showed that TF bound to interferon-α
  receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and antagonized its signaling, preventing spontaneous sterile
  inflammation and maintaining immune homeostasis. Structural modeling and direct
  binding studies revealed binding of the TF C-terminal fibronectin III domain to
  IFNAR1, ...
