description: Aging is accompanied by a dysregulation of adaptive processes. On the
  one hand, physiological adaptation mechanisms such as learning and memory, immune
  system plasticity and exercise-dependent muscle remodeling are blunted. On the other
  hand, several maladaptive processes increase with age including cancer, pathological
  cardiovascular remodeling and metabolic dysregulation. With increasing age the quotient
  of beneficial adaptation (Ab) to harmful adaptation (Ah), Ab/Ah, decreases. ...
