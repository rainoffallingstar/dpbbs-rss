description: Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are a marker of brain injury and have
  a causative effect on ischemic lesion progression. The hemodynamic responses elicited
  by SDs are contingent upon the metabolic integrity of the affected tissue, with
  vasoconstrictive reactions leading to pronounced hypoxia often indicating poor outcomes.
  The stratification of hemodynamic responses within different cortical layers remains
  poorly characterized. This pilot study sought to elucidate the depth-specific ...
