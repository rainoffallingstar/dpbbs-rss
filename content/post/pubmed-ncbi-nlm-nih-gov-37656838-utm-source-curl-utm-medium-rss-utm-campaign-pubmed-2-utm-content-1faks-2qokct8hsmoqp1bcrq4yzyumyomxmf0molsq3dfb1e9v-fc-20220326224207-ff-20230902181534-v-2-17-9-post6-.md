description: Jet quenching is the process of color-charged partons losing energy via
  interactions with quark-gluon plasma droplets created in heavy-ion collisions. The
  collective expansion of such droplets is well described by viscous hydrodynamics.
  Similar evidence of collectivity is consistently observed in smaller collision systems,
  including pp and p+Pb collisions. In contrast, while jet quenching is observed in
  Pb+Pb collisions, no evidence has been found in these small systems to date, ...
