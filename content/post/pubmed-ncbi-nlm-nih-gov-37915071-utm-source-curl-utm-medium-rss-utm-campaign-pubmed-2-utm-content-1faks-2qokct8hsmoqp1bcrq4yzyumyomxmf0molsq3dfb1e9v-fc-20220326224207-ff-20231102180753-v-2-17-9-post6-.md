description: As a complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), vasospasm substantially
  contributes to its morbidity and mortality. We aimed at analyzing predictors of
  outcome for these patients including the role of endovascular treatment (ET). Our
  database was screened for patients with SAH treated in our Neuro-ICU from 2009 to
  2019. Clinical parameters including functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS
  of 0-2 or 3-6 at discharge and after a median follow-up of 18 months) and details
  about ET ...
