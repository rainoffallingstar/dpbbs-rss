description: In vivo tissue engineering (TE) techniques like the AV loop model provide
  an isolated and well-defined microenvironment to study angiogenesis-related cell
  interactions. Functional visualization of the microvascular network within these
  artificial tissue constructs is crucial for the fundamental understanding of vessel
  network formation and to identify the underlying key regulatory mechanisms. To facilitate
  microvascular tracking advanced fluorescence imaging techniques are required. We
