description: TCRαβ/CD19-cell depletion is a promising graft manipulation technique
  frequently used in the context of HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT). We previously reported the results of a phase I-II clinical trial (NCT01810120)
  to assess the safety and the efficacy of this type of ex-vivo T cell-depletion in
  80 children with acute leukemia, showing promising survival outcomes. We now report
