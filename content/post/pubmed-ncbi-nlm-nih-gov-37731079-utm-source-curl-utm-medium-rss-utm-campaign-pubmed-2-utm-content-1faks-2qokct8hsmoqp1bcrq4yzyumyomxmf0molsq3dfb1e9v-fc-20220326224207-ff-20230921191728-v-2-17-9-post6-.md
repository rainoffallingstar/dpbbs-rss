description: Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a hereditary myocardial disease
  characterized by the replacement of the ventricular myocardium with fibrous fatty
  deposits. ACM is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with variable
  penetrance and expressivity, which is mainly related to ventricular tachyarrhythmia
  and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Importantly, significant progress has been made
  in determining the genetic background of ACM due to the development of new techniques
