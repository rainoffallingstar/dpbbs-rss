CONCLUSION: The more frequent occurrence of cn-LOHs and subsequently affected genes in brain metastases shed light on the pathophysiology of brain metastasis formation. Further pairwise genetic analyses between primary tumors and their metastases will help to define the role of affected genes in cn-LOH ...
