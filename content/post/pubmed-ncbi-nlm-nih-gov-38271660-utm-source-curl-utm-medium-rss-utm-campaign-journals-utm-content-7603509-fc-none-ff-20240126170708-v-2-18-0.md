description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy
  originating from transformed hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. AML prognosis
  remains poor, due to resistance and relapse driven by leukemia stem cells (LSCs).
  Targeting molecules essential for LSC function is a promising therapeutic approach.
  The PI3K/AKT pathway is often dysregulated in AML. We found while that PI3Kγ is
  highly enriched in LSCs and critical for self-renewal, it was dispensable for normal
