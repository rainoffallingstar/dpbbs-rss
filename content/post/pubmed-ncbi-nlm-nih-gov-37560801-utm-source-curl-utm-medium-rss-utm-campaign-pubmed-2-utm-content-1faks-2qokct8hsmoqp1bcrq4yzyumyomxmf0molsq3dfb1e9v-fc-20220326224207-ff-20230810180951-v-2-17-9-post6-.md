description: The t(14;19)(q32;q13) often juxtaposes BCL3 with IGH resulting in overexpression
  of the gene. In contrast to other oncogenic translocations, BCL3-rearrangement (BCL3-R)
  has been associated with a broad spectrum of lymphoid neoplasms. Here we report
  an integrative whole-genome sequence, transcriptomic, and DNA methylation analysis
  of 13 lymphoid neoplasms with BCL3-R. The resolution of the breakpoints at single
  base-pair revealed that they occur in two clusters at 5' (n=9) and 3' (n=4) regions
