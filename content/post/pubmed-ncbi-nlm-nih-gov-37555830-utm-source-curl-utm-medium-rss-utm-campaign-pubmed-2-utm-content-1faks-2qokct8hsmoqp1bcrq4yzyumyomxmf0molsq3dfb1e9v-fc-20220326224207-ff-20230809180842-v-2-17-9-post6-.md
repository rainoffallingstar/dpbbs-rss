description: Human neuroscience has always been pushing the boundary of what is measurable.
  During the last decade, concerns about statistical power and replicability - in
  science in general, but also specifically in human neuroscience - have fueled an
  extensive debate. One important insight from this discourse is the need for larger
  samples, which naturally increases statistical power. An alternative is to increase
  the precision of measurements, which is the focus of this review. This option is
