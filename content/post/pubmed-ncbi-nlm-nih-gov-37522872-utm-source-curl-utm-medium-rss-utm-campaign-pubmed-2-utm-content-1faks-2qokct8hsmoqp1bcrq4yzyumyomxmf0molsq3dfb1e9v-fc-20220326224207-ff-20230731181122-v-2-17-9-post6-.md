description: Embryo implantation into the uterus marks a key transition in mammalian
  development. In mice, implantation is mediated by the trophoblast and is accompanied
  by a morphological transition from the blastocyst to the egg cylinder. However,
  the roles of trophoblast-uterine interactions in embryo morphogenesis during implantation
  are poorly understood due to inaccessibility in utero and the remaining challenges
  to recapitulate it ex vivo from the blastocyst. Here, we engineer a ...
