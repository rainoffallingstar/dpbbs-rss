description: In recent years, Rydberg excitations in atomic quantum gases have become
  a successful platform to explore quantum impurity problems. A single impurity immersed
  in a Fermi gas leads to the formation of a polaron, a quasiparticle consisting of
  the impurity being dressed by the surrounding medium. With a radius of about the
  Fermi wavelength, the density profile of a polaron cannot be explored using in situ
  optical imaging techniques. In this Letter, we propose a new experimental ...
