description: In motor control, the brain not only sends motor commands to the periphery,
  but also generates concurrent internal signals known as corollary discharge (CD)
  that influence sensory information processing around the time of movement. CD signals
  are important for identifying sensory input arising from self-motion and to compensate
  for it, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp
  recordings from neurons in the zebrafish optic tectum, we discovered an ...
