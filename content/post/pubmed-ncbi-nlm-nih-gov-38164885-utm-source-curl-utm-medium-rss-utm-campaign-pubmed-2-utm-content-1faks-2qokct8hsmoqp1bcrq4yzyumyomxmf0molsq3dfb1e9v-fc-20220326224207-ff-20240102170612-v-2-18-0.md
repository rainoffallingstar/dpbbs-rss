description: Targeted manipulation of neural activity via light has become an indispensable
  tool for gaining insights into the intricate processes governing single neurons
  and complex neural networks. To shed light onto the underlying interaction mechanisms,
  it is crucial to achieve precise control of individual neural activity, as well
  as a spatial read-out resolution on the nanoscale. Here, a versatile photonic platform
  with subcellular resolution for stimulation and monitoring of in-vitro neurons ...
