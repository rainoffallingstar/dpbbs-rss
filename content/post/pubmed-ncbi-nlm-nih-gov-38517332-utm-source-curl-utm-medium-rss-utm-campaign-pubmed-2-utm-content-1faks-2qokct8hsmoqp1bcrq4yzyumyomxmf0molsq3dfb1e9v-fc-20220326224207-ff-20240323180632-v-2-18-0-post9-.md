description: Heterozygous mutations in the TBK1 gene can cause amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The majority of TBK1-ALS/FTD
  patients carry deleterious loss-of-expression mutations, and it is still unclear
  which TBK1 function leads to neurodegeneration. We investigated the impact of the
  pathogenic TBK1 missense variant p.E696K, which does not abolish protein expression,
  but leads to a selective loss of TBK1 binding to the autophagy adaptor protein and
