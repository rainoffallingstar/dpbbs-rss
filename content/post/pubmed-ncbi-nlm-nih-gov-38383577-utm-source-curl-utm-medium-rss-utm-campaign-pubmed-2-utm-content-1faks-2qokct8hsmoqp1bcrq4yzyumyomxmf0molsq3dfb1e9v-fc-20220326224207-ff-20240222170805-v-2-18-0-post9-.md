description: Efficient fiber-to-chip couplers for multi-port access to photonic integrated
  circuits are paramount for a broad class of applications, ranging, e.g., from telecommunication
  to photonic computing and quantum technologies. Grating-based approaches are often
  desirable for providing out-of-plane access to the photonic circuits. However, on
  photonic platforms characterized by a refractive index ≃ 2 at telecom wavelength,
  such as silicon nitride or thin-film lithium niobate, the limited ...
