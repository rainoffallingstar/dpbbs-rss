description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a lethal disease, requires a
  grasp of its biology for effective therapies. Exosomes, implicated in cancer, are
  poorly understood in living systems. Here we use the genetically engineered mouse
  model (ExoBow) to map the spatiotemporal distribution of exosomes from healthy and
  PDAC pancreas in vivo to determine their biological significance. We show that,
  within the PDAC microenvironment, cancer cells establish preferential communication
  routes ...
