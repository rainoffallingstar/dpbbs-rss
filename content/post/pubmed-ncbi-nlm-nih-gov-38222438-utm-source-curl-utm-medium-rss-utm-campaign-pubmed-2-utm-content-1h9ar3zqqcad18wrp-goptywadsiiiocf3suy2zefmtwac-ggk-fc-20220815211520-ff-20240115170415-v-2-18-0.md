description: Low-yield repetitive laboratory diagnostics burden patients and inflate
  cost of care. In this study, we assess whether stability in repeated laboratory
  diagnostic measurements is predictable with uncertainty estimates using electronic
  health record data available before the diagnostic is ordered. We use probabilistic
  regression to predict a distribution of plausible values, allowing use-time customization
  for various definitions of "stability" given dynamic ranges and clinical scenarios.
