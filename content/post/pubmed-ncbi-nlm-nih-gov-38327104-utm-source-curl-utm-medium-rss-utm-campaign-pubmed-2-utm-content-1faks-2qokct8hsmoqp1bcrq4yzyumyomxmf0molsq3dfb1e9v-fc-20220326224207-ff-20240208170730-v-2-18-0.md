description: Natural killer (NK) cells are innate cytokine-producing and cytolytic
  effector lymphocytes. Their function is responsive to environmental factors, e.g.,
  hypoxia, a frequent feature of inflamed tissues. Such responses require that the
  NK cells up-regulate HIF-1α (hypoxia inducible factor-1α), the major mediator of
  cellular responses to hypoxia that affects cell survival as well as immune responses.
  Thus, a major approach to the study of NK cell effector function under hypoxic conditions
