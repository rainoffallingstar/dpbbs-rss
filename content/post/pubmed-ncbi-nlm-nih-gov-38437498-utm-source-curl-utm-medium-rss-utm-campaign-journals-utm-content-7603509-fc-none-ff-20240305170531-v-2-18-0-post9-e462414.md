description: BRG1 (SMARCA4) and BRM (SMARCA2) are the mutually exclusive core ATPases
  of the chromatin remodeling BAF (BRG1/BRM-associated factor) complexes. They enable
  transcription factors/co-factors to access enhancers/promoter and modulate gene-expressions
  responsible for cell growth and differentiation of AML stem/progenitor cells. In
  AML with MLL1r (MLL1 rearrangement) or mutant (mt) NPM1, although Menin inhibitor
  (MI) treatment induces clinical remissions, most patients either fail to respond
