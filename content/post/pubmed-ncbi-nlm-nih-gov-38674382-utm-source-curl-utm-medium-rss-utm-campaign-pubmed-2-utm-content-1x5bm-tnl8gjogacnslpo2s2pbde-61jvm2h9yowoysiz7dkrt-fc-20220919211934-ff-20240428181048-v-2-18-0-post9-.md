description: This study explores the genetic risk associations with autism spectrum
  disorder (ASD) using graph neural networks (GNNs), leveraging the Sfari dataset
  and protein interaction network (PIN) data. We built a gene network with genes as
  nodes, chromosome band location as node features, and gene interactions as edges.
  Graph models were employed to classify the autism risk associated with newly introduced
  genes (test set). Three classification tasks were undertaken to test the ability
  of our ...
