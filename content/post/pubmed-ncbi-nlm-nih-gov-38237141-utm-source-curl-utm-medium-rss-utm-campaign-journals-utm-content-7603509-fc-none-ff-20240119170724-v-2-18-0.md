description: The sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate (HD) domain containing
  protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase with ara-CTPase
  activity that confers cytarabine (ara-C) resistance in several haematological malignancies.
  Targeting SAMHD1's ara-CTPase activity has recently been demonstrated to enhance
  ara-C efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we identify the transcription factor
  SRY-related HMG-box containing protein 11 (SOX11) as a novel direct ...
