description: Disease-causing mutations in genes encoding transcription factors (TFs)
  can affect TF interactions with their cognate DNA-binding motifs. Whether and how
  TF mutations impact upon the binding to TF composite elements (CE) and the interaction
  with other TFs is unclear. Here, we report a distinct mechanism of TF alteration
  in human lymphomas with perturbed B cell identity, in particular classic Hodgkin
  lymphoma. It is caused by a recurrent somatic missense mutation c.295 T > C (p.Cys99Arg;
