description: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies generate multiple data types
  from biological samples, namely gene expression, physical distance between data
  points, and/or tissue morphology. Here we developed three computational-statistical
  algorithms that integrate all three data types to advance understanding of cellular
  processes. First, we present a spatial graph-based method, pseudo-time-space (PSTS),
  to model and uncover relationships between transcriptional states of cells across
