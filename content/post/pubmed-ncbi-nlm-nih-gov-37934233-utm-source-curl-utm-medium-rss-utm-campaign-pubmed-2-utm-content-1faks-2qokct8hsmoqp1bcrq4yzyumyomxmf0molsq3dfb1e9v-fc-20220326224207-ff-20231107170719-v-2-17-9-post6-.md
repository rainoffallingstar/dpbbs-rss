description: S-ketamine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, and psilocybin,
  a 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (serotonin) 2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) agonist, are reported
  as effective rapid-acting antidepressants. Both compounds increase glutamate signalling
  and evoke cortical hyperexcitation. S-ketamine induces neurotoxicity especially
  in the retrosplenial cortex (Olney's lesions). Whether psilocybin produces similar
  neurotoxic effects has so far not been investigated. We performed an immunohistochemical...
