description: The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcriptional factor that plays a crucial
  role in controlling acute toxicity and long-term malignant transformation of hematopoietic
  cells induced by genotoxic stress such as ionizing radiation. Among all transcriptional
  targets of p53, one gene that is robustly induced by radiation is the pleckstrin
  homology domain-only protein Phlda3. However, the role that Phlda3 plays in regulating
  the response of hematopoietic cells to radiation is unknown. Here, ...
