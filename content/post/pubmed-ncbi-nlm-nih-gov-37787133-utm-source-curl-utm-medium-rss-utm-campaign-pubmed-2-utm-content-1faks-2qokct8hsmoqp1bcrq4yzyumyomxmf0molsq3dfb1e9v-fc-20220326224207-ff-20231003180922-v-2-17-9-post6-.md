description: In this paper we present the Markovian Multiagent Monte-Carlo Second
  Order Self-Consistent Field Algorithm (M3-SOSCF). This algorithm provides a highly
  reliable methodology for converging SCF calculations in single-reference methods
  using a modified differential evolution approach. Additionally, M3 is embarrassingly
  parallel and modular in regards to Newton-Raphson subroutines. We show that M3 is
  able to surpass contemporary SOSCFs in reliability, which is illustrated by a benchmark
