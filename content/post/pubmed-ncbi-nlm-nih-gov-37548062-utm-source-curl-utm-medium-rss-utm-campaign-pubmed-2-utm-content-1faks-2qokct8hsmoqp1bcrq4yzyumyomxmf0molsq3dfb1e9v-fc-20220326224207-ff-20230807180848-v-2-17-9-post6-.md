description: Primary adrenal insufficiency is a life-threatening disorder, which requires
  lifelong hormone replacement therapy. Transplantation of xenogeneic adrenal cells
  is a potential alternative approach for the treatment of adrenal insufficiency.
  For a successful outcome of this replacement therapy, transplanted cells should
  provide adequate hormone secretion and respond to adrenal physiological stimuli.
  Here, we describe the generation and characterization of primary porcine adrenal
  spheroids ...
