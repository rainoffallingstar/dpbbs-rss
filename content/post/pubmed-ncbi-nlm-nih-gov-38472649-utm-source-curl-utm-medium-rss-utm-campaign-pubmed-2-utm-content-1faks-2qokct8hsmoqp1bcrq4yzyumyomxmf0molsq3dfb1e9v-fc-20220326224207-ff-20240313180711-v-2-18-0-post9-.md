description: The formation of mammalian synapses entails the precise alignment of
  presynaptic release sites with postsynaptic receptors but how nascent cell-cell
  contacts translate into assembly of presynaptic specializations remains unclear.
  Guided by pioneering work in invertebrates, we hypothesized that in mammalian synapses,
  liprin-α proteins directly link trans-synaptic initial contacts to downstream steps.
  Here we show that, in human neurons lacking all four liprin-α isoforms, nascent
  synaptic ...
