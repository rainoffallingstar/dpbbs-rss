description: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Inhibitors
  targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint have improved MCC
  patient outcomes by boosting antitumor T cell immunity. Here, we identify PD-1 as
  a growth-promoting receptor intrinsic to MCC cells. In human MCC lines and clinical
  tumors, RT-PCR-based sequencing, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence
  analyses demonstrated PD-1 gene and protein expression by MCC cells. MCC-PD-1 ...
