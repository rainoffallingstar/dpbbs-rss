description: In physiological conditions, few circulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor
  cells (cHSPC) are present in the peripheral blood but their contribution to hematopoietic
  homeostasis in humans remain unsolved. By integrating advanced immunophenotyping,
  cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), functional
  single-cell assays and integration site (IS) clonal tracking, we unveiled the phenotypic
  composition, the transcriptional features and the biological role of ...
