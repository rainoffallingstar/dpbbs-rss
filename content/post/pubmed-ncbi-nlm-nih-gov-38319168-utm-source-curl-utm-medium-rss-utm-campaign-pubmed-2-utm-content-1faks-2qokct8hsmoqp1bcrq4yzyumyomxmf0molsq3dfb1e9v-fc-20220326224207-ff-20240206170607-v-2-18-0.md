description: Filters are commonly used to enhance specific structures and patterns
  in images, such as vessels or peritumoral regions, to enable clinical insights beyond
  the visible image using radiomics. However, their lack of standardization restricts
  reproducibility and clinical translation of radiomics decision support tools. In
  this special report, teams of researchers who developed radiomics software participated
