description: Enhancing cancer treatment efficacy remains a significant challenge in
  human health. Immunotherapy has witnessed considerable success in recent years as
  a treatment for tumors. However, due to the heterogeneity of diseases, only a fraction
  of patients exhibit a positive response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.
  Various single-gene-based biomarkers and tumor mutational burden (TMB) have been
  proposed for predicting clinical responses to ICI; however, their predictive ability
