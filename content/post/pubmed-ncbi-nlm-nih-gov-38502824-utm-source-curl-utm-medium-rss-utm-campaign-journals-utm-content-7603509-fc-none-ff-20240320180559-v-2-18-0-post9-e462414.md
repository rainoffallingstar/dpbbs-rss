description: Previous studies have demonstrated that more than 38% of immune-mediated
  thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patients in remission with activity >50%
  had an open ADAMTS13 conformation. We assessed ADAMTS13 conformation in remission
  (ADAMTS13 activity >60%), focussing on peak ADAMTS13 activity levels and longitudinal
  assessment in 420 samples across 157 patients. Fewer cases had open conformation
  at peak ADAMTS13 activity compared to unselected remission samples with ADAMTS13
