description: Identifying sex-linked markers in genomic datasets is important because
  their presence in supposedly neutral autosomal datasets can result in incorrect
  estimates of genetic diversity, population structure and parentage. However, detecting
  sex-linked loci can be challenging, and available scripts neglect some categories
  of sex-linked variation. Here, we present new R functions to (1) identify and separate
  sex-linked loci in ZW and XY sex determination systems and (2) infer the genetic
