description: We aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility, and long-term results
  of drug-eluting stent implantation before covered stents for treating coronary artery
  perforation (CAP). Between 2015 and 2020, 12,733 patients undergoing percutaneous
  coronary intervention (PCI) were retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint
  was 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR), whereas secondary endpoints included
  the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause
  death at ...
