description: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have transformed the therapeutic landscape
  in oncology. However, ICI can induce uncommon life-threatening autoimmune T-cell-mediated
  myotoxicities, including myocarditis and myositis. The thymus plays a critical role
  in T cell maturation. Here we demonstrate that thymic alterations are associated
  with increased incidence and severity of ICI myotoxicities. First, using the international
