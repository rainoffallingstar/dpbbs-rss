description: Plant-derived multitarget compounds may represent a promising therapeutic
  strategy for multifactorial diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Artemisinin
  and its derivatives were indicated to beneficially modulate various aspects of AD
  pathology in different AD animal models through the regulation of a wide range of
  different cellular processes, such as energy homeostasis, apoptosis, proliferation
  and inflammatory pathways. In this review, we aimed to provide an up-to-date overview
