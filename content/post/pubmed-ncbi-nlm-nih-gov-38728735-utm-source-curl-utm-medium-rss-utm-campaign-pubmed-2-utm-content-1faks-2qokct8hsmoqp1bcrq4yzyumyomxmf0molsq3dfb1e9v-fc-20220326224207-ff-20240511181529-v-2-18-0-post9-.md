description: This Letter presents the measurement of near-side associated per-trigger
  yields, denoted ridge yields, from the analysis of angular correlations of charged
  hadrons in proton-proton collisions at sqrt[s]=13 TeV. Long-range ridge yields are
  extracted for pairs of charged particles with a pseudorapidity difference of 1.4<|Δη|<1.8
  and a transverse momentum of 1<p_{T}<2 GeV/c, as a function of the charged-particle
  multiplicity measured at midrapidity. This Letter extends the measurements of the
