description: Here, a straightforward method is reported for manufacturing 3D microstructured
  cell-adhesive and cell-repellent multimaterials using two-photon laser printing.
  Compared to existing strategies, this approach offers bottom-up molecular control,
  high customizability, and rapid and precise 3D fabrication. The printable cell-adhesive
  polyethylene glycol (PEG) based material includes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) containing
  peptide synthesized through solid-phase peptide synthesis, allowing for ...
