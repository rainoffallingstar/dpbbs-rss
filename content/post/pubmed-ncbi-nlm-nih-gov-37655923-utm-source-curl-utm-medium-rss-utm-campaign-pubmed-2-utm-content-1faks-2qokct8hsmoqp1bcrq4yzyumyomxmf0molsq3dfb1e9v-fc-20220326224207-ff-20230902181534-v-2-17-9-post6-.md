description: Acquisition of PBP2a (encoded by the mec gene) is the key resistance
  mechanism to β-lactams in Staphylococcus aureus. The mec gene can be easily detected
  by PCR assays; however, these tools will miss mec-independent oxacillin resistance.
  This phenotype is mediated by mutations in cell wall metabolism genes that can be
  acquired during persistent infections under prolonged antibiotic exposure. The complex
  case presented by Hess et al. (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 67:e00437-23, ...
