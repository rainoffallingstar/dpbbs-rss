description: Despite increasing evidence that cholesterol precursors and oxysterols,
  oxidized cholesterol metabolites, play a role in numerous pathological processes
  and diseases including breast cancer, little is known about correlates of these
  sterols in women with breast cancer. In this study, 2282 women with breast cancer
  and blood draw post diagnosis were included and cross-sectional associations between
  circulating levels of 15 sterols/oxysterols and (a) lifestyle, anthropometric, ...
