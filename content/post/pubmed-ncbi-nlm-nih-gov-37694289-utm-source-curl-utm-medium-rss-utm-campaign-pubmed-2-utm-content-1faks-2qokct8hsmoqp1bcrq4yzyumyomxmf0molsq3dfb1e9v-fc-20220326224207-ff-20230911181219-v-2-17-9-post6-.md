description: A growing proportion of head and neck cancer (HNC), especially oropharyngeal
  cancer (OPC), is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). There are several markers
  for HPV-driven HNC, one being HPV early antigen serology. We aimed to investigate
  the diagnostic accuracy of HPV serology and its performance across patient characteristics.
  Data from the VOYAGER consortium was used, which comprises five studies on HNC from
  North America and Europe. Diagnostic accuracy, that is, sensitivity, ...
