description: Collagen VII forms anchoring fibrils that are essential for the stability
  of the skin and other epithelial organs. In addition to such structural functions,
  it is emerging that collagen VII fills instructive functions. Collagen VII is synthesized
  by both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Genetic loss of collagen VII causes dystrophic
  epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), which manifests with chronic skin fragility and fibrosis.
  Significant progress has been made on developing therapies for DEB, ...
