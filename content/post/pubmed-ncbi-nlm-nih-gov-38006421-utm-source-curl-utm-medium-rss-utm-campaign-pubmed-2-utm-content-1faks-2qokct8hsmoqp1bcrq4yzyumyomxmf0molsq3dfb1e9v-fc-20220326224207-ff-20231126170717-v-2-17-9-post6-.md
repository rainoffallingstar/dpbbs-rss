description: Previous studies have identified a 'defensive graded field' in the peripersonal
  front space where potential threatening stimuli induce stronger blink responses,
  mainly modulated by top-down mechanisms, which include various factors, such as
  proximity to the body, stimulus valence, and social cues. However, very little is
  known about the mechanisms responsible for representation of the back space and
  the possible role of bottom-up information. By means of acoustic stimuli, we ...
