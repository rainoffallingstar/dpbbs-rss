description: Activated Notch signaling is highly prevalent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (T-ALL) but pan-Notch inhibitors showed excessive toxicity in clinical
  trials. To find alternative ways to target Notch signals, we investigated Cell division
  cycle 73 (Cdc73), which is a Notch cofactor and key component of the RNA polymerase-associated
  transcriptional machinery, an emerging target in T-ALL. While we confirmed previous
  work that CDC73 interacts with NOTCH1, we also found that the interaction ...
