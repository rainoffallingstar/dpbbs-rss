description: High-risk, complement mediated, untreated transplant-associated thrombotic
  microangiopathy (hrTMA) has dismal outcomes due to multi-organ dysfunction (MODS).
  The complement C5 blocker eculizumab shows promising results in hrTMA, but has not
  been prospectively studied in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients.
  We performed the first multi-institutional prospective study in children and young
