description: Beet curly top Iran virus (BCTIV) is a yield-limiting geminivirus belonging
  to the becurtovirus genus. The genome organization of BCTIV is unique such that
  the complementary strand of BCTIV resembles Mastrevirus, whereas the virion strand
  organization is similar to the Curtovirus genus. Geminiviruses are known to avoid
  the plant defense system by suppressing the RNA interference mechanisms both at
  the transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) and post-transcriptional gene silencing
  (PTGS) ...
