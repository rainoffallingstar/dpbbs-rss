description: The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective
  cation channel expressed on sensory neurons and immune cells. We hypothesize that
  TRPV1 plays a role in human eosinophil function and is modulated by inflammatory
  conditions. TRPV1 expression on human eosinophils was examined by qPCR, flow cytometry,
  and immunohistochemistry, respectively. TRPV1 functionality was analyzed by investigating
  calcium flux, apoptosis, modulation by cytokines and acidic pH, and ...
