description: 'CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that CNV analysis can identify the genetic
  cause in SRNS families that remained unsolved after ES. Though the rate of detected
  CNVs is minor, CNV analysis can be used when there are no other genetic causes identified.
  Causative CNVs are less common in SRNS than in other monogenic kidney diseases,
  such as congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, where the detection
  rate was 5.3%. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available
