description: Here we show that MINSTED localization, a method whereby the position
  of a fluorophore is identified with precisely controlled beams of a STED microscope,
  tracks fluorophores and hence labeled biomolecules with nanometer/millisecond spatiotemporal
  precision. By updating the position for each detected photon, MINSTED recognizes
  fluorophore steps of 16 nm within <250 μs using about 13 photons. The power of MINSTED
  tracking is demonstrated by resolving the stepping of the motor protein ...
