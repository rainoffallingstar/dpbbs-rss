description: A growing number of druggable targets and national initiatives for precision
  oncology necessitate broad genomic profiling for many cancer patients. Whole exome
  sequencing (WES) offers unbiased analysis of the entire coding sequence, segmentation-based
  detection of copy number alterations (CNAs), and accurate determination of complex
  biomarkers including tumor mutational burden (TMB), homologous recombination repair
  deficiency (HRD), and microsatellite instability (MSI). To assess ...
