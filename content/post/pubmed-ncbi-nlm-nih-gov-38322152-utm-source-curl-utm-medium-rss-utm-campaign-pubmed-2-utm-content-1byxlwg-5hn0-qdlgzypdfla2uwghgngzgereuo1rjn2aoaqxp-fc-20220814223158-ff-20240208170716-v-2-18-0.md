description: In this study, we present a deep-learning-based multimodal classification
  method for lymphoma diagnosis in digital pathology, which utilizes a whole slide
  image (WSI) as the primary image data and flow cytometry (FCM) data as auxiliary
  information. In pathological diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, FCM serves as valuable
  auxiliary information during the diagnosis process, offering useful insights into
  predicting the major class (superclass) of subtypes. By incorporating both images
  and FCM ...
