description: Sustainable diets are gaining interest as a possible approach to tackle
  climate change and the global extent of obesity. Yet, the association between sustainable
  diets and adiposity remains unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis,
  calculating summary relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We pooled
  maximally adjusted risk estimates, assessed heterogeneity and publication bias,
  calculated the E-value, and evaluated the risk of bias across the included studies.
