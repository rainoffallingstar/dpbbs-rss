description: We have recently shown that loss of ORP3 leads to aneuploidy induction
  and promotes tumor formation. However, the specific mechanisms by which ORP3 contributes
  to ploidy-control and cancer initiation and progression is still unknown. Here,
  we report that ORP3 is highly expressed in ureter and bladder epithelium while its
  expression is downregulated in invasive bladder cancer cell lines and during tumor
  progression, both in human and in mouse bladder cancer. Moreover, we observed an
  increase ...
