description: Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a substantial cause of morbidity
  and mortality worldwide and represents a spectrum of liver injury beginning with
  hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) progressing to inflammation and culminating in cirrhosis.
  Multiple factors contribute to ALD progression and disease severity. Here, we overview
  several crucial mechanisms related to ALD end-stage outcome development, such as
  epigenetic changes, cell death, hemolysis, hepatic stellate cells activation, ...
