description: Chromatin has been shown to undergo diffusional motion, which is affected
  during gene transcription by RNA polymerase activity. However, the relationship
  between chromatin mobility and other genomic processes remains unclear. Hence, we
  set out to label the DNA directly in a sequence unbiased manner and followed labeled
  chromatin dynamics in interphase human cells expressing GFP-tagged proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cell cycle marker and core component of the DNA ...
