  proteins. In bacteria, aggregated proteins are rescued by the canonical Hsp70/AAA+
  (ClpB) bi-chaperone disaggregase. Man-made, severe stress conditions applied during,
  e.g., food processing represent a novel threat for bacteria by exceeding the capacity
  of the Hsp70/ClpB system. Here, we report on the potent autonomous AAA+ disaggregase
