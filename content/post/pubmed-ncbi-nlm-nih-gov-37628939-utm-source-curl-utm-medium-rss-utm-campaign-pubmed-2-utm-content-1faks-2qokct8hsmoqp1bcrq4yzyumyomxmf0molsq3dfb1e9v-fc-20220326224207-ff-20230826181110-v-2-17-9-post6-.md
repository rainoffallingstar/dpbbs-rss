  injury mechanisms after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI); therefore, we
  assessed the effect of a therapeutic IL-4 administration on secondary brain damage
  after experimental TBI. We subjected 100 C57/Bl6 wildtype mice to controlled cortical
  impact (CCI) and administered IL-4 or a placebo control subcutaneously 15 min thereafter.
