description: How chromatin enzymes work in condensed chromatin and how they maintain
  diffusional mobility inside remains unexplored. Here we investigated these challenges
  using the Drosophila ISWI remodeling ATPase, which slides nucleosomes along DNA.
  Folding of chromatin fibers did not affect sliding in vitro. Catalytic rates were
  also comparable in- and outside of chromatin condensates. ISWI cross-links and thereby
  stiffens condensates, except when ATP hydrolysis is possible. Active hydrolysis
