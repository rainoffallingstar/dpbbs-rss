description: The fraction of χ_{c1} and χ_{c2} decays in the prompt J/ψ yield, F_{χ_{c}→J/ψ}=σ_{χ_{c}→J/ψ}/σ_{J/ψ},
  is measured by the LHCb detector in pPb collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=8.16 TeV. The
  study covers the forward (1.5<y^{*}<4.0) and backward (-5.0<y^{*}<-2.5) rapidity
  regions, where y^{*} is the J/ψ rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass system.
  Forward and backward rapidity samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 13.6±0.3
  and 20.8±0.5 nb^{-1}, respectively. The result is ...
