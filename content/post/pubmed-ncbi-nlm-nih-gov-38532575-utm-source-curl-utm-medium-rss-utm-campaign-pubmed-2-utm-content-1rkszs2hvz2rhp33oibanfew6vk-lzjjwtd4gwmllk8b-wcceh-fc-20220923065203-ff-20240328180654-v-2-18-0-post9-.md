description: Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous group of haematological
  cancers with generally poor clinical outcomes. However, a subset of patients experience
  durable disease control, and little is known regarding long-term outcomes. The International
  T-cell Lymphoma Project (ITCLP) is the largest prospectively collected cohort of
  patients with PTCLs, providing insight into clinical outcomes at academic medical
  centres globally. We performed a long-term outcome analysis on patients ...
