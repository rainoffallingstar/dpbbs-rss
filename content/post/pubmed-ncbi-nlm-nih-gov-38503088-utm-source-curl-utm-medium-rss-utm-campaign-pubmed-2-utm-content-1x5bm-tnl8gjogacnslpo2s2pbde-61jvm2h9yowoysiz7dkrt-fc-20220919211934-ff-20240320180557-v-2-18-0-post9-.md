description: Gastrointestinal cancer, a highly prevalent form of cancer, has been
  the subject of extensive research resulting in the identification of numerous pathogenic
  genes. However, validation and exploration of these findings often require traditional
  biological experiments, which are time-consuming and limit the ability to make extensive
  assessments promptly. To address this challenge, this paper introduces GGDisnet,
  a novel model for identifying genes associated with gastrointestinal cancer. ...
