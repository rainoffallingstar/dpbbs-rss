description: The electronic and nuclear dynamics inside molecules are essential for
  chemical reactions, where different pathways typically unfold on ultrafast timescales.
  Extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses generated by free-electron lasers (FELs)
  allow atomic-site and electronic-state selectivity, triggering specific molecular
  dynamics while providing femtosecond resolution. Yet, time-resolved experiments
  are either blind to neutral fragments or limited by the spectral bandwidth of FEL
  pulses. Here, ...
