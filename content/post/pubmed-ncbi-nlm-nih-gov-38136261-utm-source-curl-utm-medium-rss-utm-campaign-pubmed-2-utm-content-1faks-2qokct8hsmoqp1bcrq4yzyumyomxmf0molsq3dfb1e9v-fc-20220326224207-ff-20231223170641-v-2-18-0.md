description: Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the most lethal urological
  malignancies. However, small, localized RCCs (≤7 cm, stage T1) have an excellent
  prognosis. There is a rare patient subgroup diagnosed with synchronous distant metastasis
  (T1N0M1), of which very little is known in terms of survival outcomes and underlying
  disease biology. Herein, we examined the long-term survival of 27 patients with
  clear cell RCC (ccRCC) stage T1N0M1 in comparison to 18 patients without ...
