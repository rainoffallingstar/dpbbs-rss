description: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway is a complex regulatory
  network that plays a critical role in various biological processes, including cellular
  metabolism, development, and immune responses. The complexity of AHR signaling arises
  from multiple factors, including the diverse ligands that activate the receptor,
  the expression level of AHR itself, and its interaction with the AHR nuclear translocator
  (ARNT). Additionally, the AHR crosstalks with the AHR repressor (AHRR) ...
