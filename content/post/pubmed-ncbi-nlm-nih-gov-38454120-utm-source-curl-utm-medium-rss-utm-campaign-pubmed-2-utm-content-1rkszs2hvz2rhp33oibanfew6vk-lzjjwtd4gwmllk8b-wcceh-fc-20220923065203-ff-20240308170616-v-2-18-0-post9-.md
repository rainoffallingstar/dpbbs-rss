description: Although Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors (BTKi) have significantly
  improved patient prognosis, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is still considered incurable
  due to primary and acquired resistance. We have recently shown that aberrant expression
  of the Src-family tyrosine kinase hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK) in MCL correlates
  with poor prognosis, and that genetic HCK perturbation impairs growth and integrin-mediated
  adhesion of MCL cells. Here, we show that KIN-8194, a dual inhibitor ...
