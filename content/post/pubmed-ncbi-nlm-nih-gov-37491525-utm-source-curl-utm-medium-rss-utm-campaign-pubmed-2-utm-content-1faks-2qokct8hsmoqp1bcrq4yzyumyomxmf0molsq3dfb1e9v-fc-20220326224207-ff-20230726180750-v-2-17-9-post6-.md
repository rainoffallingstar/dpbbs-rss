description: In response to nutritional stress, microtubules in cells of the Drosophila
  female germline are depleted from the cytoplasm and accumulate cortically. This
  triggers aggregation of mRNPs into large processing bodies (P-bodies) and oogenesis

  microtubule dynamics and P-body formation. We found that depletion of histone deacetylase
  1 (HDAC1) by RNAi phenocopies the nutritional stress response, causing ...
