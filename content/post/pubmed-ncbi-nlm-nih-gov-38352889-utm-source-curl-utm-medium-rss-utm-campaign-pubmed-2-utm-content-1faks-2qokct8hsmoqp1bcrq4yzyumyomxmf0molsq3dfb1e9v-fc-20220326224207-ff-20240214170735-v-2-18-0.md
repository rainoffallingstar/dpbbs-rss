description: Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumours affecting their biology
  and response to therapy. One of the main transcription factors activated by hypoxia
  is hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), which regulates the expression of genes involved
  in various aspects of tumourigenesis including proliferative capacity, angiogenesis,
  immune evasion, metabolic reprogramming, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling,
  and cell migration. This can negatively impact patient outcomes by inducing ...
