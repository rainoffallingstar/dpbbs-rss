description: Tripartite biotic interactions are inherently complex, and the strong
  interdependence of species and often one-sided exploitation can make these systems
  vulnerable to extinction. The persistence of species depends then on the balance
  between exploitation and avoidance of exploitation beyond the point where sustainable
  resource use is no longer possible. We used this general prediction to test the
