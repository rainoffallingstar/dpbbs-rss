description: Immune cell phenotyping frequently detects lineage-unrelated receptors.
  Here, we report that surface receptors can be transferred from primary macrophages
  to CD4 T cells and identify the Fcγ receptor CD32 as driver and cargo of this trogocytotic
  transfer. Filamentous CD32^(+) nanoprotrusions deposit distinct plasma membrane
  patches onto target T cells. Transferred receptors confer cell migration and adhesion
  properties, and macrophage-derived membrane patches render resting CD4 T ...
