description: Near-infrared electroluminescence from carbon-based emitters, especially
  in the second biological window (NIR-II) or at telecommunication wavelengths, is
  difficult to achieve. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been proposed
  as a possible solution due to their tunable and narrowband emission in the near-infrared
  region and high charge carrier mobilities. Furthermore, the covalent functionalization
  of SWCNTs with a controlled number of luminescent sp³ defects leads to even ...
