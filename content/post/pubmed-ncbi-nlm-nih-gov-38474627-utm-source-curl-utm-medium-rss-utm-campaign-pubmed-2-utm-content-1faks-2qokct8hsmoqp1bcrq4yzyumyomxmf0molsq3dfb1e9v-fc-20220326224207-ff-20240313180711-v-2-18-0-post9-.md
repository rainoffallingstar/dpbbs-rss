description: Reactions of the technetium(I) nitrosyl complex [Tc(NO)(Cp)(PPh(3))Cl]
  with triphenylphosphine chalcogenides EPPh(3) (E = O, S, Se), and Ag(PF(6)) in a
  CH(2)Cl(2)/MeOH mixture (v/v, 2/1) result in an exchange of the chlorido ligand
  and the formation of [Tc(NO)(Cp)(PPh(3))(EPPh(3))](PF(6)) compounds. The cationic
  acetonitrile complex [Tc(NO)(Cp)(PPh(3))(NCCH(3))]^(+) is formed when the reaction
  is conducted in NCCH(3) without additional ligands. During the isolation of the
  corresponding ...
