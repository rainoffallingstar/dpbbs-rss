description: The aim of this study was to test whether the availability of internal
  imagery elicited by words is related to ratings of word imageability. Participants
  are presented with target words and, after a delay allowing for processing of the
  word, answer questions regarding the size or weight of the word referents. Target
  words differ with respect to imageability. Results show faster responses to questions
  for high imageability words than for low imageability words. The type of question
