description: Skin inflammation is a complex process implicated in various dermatological
  disorders. The chronic proliferative dermatitis (cpd) phenotype driven by the cpd
  mutation (cpdm) in the Sharpin gene is characterized by dermal inflammation and
  epidermal abnormalities. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and caspase-8-driven cell
  death causes the pathogenesis of Sharpin^(cpdm) mice; however, the role of mind
  bomb 2 (MIB2), a pro-survival E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in TNF signaling, in
  skin ...
