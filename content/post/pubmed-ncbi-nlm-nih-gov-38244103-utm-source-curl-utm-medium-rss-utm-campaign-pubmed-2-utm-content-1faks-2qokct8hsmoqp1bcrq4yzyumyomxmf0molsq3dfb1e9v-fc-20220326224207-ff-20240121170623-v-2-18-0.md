description: Peroxisomes are highly dynamic, oxidative organelles with key metabolic
  functions in cellular lipid metabolism, such as the β-oxidation of fatty acids and
  the synthesis of myelin sheath lipids, as well as the regulation of cellular redox
  balance. Loss of peroxisomal functions causes severe metabolic disorders in humans.
  Furthermore, peroxisomes also fulfil protective roles in pathogen and viral defence
  and immunity, highlighting their wider significance in human health and disease.
