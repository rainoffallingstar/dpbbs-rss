description: Differences in survival according to the pTERT mutation subtypes (-124C
  > T, -146C > T, and tandem -138_139CC > TT) have been observed. The present study
  aimed to describe the clinical as the histopathological and molecular cutaneous
  melanoma features according to the presence of the three most prevalent pTERT mutation
  subtypes (-124C > T, -146C > T, and tandem -138_139CC > TT). A retrospective cross-sectional
  study including 684 patients was designed, and a Partial Least-Squares ...
