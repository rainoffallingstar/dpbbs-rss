description: Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis
  catalyzing the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH(4) )-dependent hydroxylation of tyrosine
  to L-DOPA. Here, we analyzed 25 TH variants associated with various degrees of dopa-responsive
  dystonia and evaluate the effect of each variant on protein stability, activity
  and cellular localization. Furthermore, we investigated the physical interaction
  between TH and human wildtype (wt) GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GTPCH) and the effect ...
