  time-independently prevented repeated intestinal biopsies in our patient population
  and allowed us to perform a one-stage TERPT in the first months of life, reducing
  the number of enterostomies and restoring colonic continuity early. Patients undergoing
  transanal pull-through under the age of 3 months require a close follow-up to detect
  cases with bowel movement ...'
