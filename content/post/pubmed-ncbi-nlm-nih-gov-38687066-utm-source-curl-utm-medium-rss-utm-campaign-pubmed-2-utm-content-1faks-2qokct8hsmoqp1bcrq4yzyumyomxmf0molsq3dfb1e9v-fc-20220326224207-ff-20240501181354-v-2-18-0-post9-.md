description: Given low seroconversion rates following human papillomavirus (HPV) infection,
  fixed external cutoffs may lead to errors in estimating HPV seroprevalence. We evaluated
  finite mixture modeling (FMM) and group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) among unvaccinated,
  sexually active, HPV-exposed women to determine study-specific HPV16 and HPV18 seropositivity
  thresholds. We included 399 women (aged 18-24 years) enrolled in the HPV Infection
  and Transmission Among Couples Through Heterosexual ...
