description: Here, we exploit a deep serological profiling strategy coupled with an
  integrated, computational framework for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 humoral immune
  responses. Applying a high-density peptide array (HDPA) spanning the entire proteomes
  of SARS-CoV-2 and endemic human coronaviruses allowed identification of B cell epitopes
  and relate them to their evolutionary and structural properties. We identify hotspots
  of pre-existing immunity and identify cross-reactive epitopes that contribute ...
