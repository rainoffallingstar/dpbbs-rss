description: 'CONCLUSIONS: This large cohort study showed that polypharmacy and frailty
  are independent risk factors for major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular disease-specific
  and all-cause mortality in both middle-aged (40-64 years) and older people (≥ 65
  years). In addition, the hazard ratios of polypharmacy were stronger among (pre-)frail
  than non-frail study participants. This underlines the need to avoid polypharmacy
  as far as possible not only in older but also in middle-aged subjects ...'
