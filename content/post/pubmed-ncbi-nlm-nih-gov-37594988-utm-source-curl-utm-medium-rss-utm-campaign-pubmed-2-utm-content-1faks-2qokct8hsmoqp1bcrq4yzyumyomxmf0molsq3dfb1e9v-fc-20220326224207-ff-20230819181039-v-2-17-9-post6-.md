description: Pathogenic bacteria proliferating inside mammalian host cells need to
  rapidly adapt to the intracellular environment. How they achieve this and scavenge
  essential nutrients from the host has been an open question due to the difficulties
  in distinguishing between bacterial and host metabolites in situ. Here, we capitalized
  on the inability of mammalian cells to metabolize mannitol to develop a stable isotopic
  labeling approach to track Salmonella enterica metabolites during ...
