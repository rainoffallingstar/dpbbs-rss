description: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) implantation is
  an effective treatment of portal hypertension in patients with decompensated liver
  cirrhosis. However, some patients develop TIPS thrombosis with recurrence of portal
  hypertension. The role of platelets in TIPS thrombosis and the necessity of antiplatelet
  therapy is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to study platelet function in patients with
  liver cirrhosis prior to and after TIPS implantation. Platelet aggregation was tested
