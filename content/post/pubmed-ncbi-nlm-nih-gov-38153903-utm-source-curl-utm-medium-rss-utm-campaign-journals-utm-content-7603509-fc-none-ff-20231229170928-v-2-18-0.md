description: The CD161 inhibitory receptor is highly upregulated by tumor-infiltrating
  T-cells in multiple human solid tumor types, and its ligand CLEC2D is expressed
  by both tumor cells and infiltrating myeloid cells. Here we assessed the role of
  the CD161 receptor in hematological malignancies. Systematic analysis of CLEC2D
  expression using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) revealed that CLEC2D mRNA
  was most abundant in hematological malignancies, including B-cell and T-cell lymphomas
  as well ...
