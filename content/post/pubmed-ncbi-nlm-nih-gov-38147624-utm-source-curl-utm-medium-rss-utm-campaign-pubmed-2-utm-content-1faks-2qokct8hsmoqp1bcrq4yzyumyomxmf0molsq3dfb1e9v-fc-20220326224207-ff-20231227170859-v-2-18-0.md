description: It is still not fully understood how genetic haploinsufficiency in del(5q)
  MDS contributes to malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. We asked
  how compound haploinsufficiency for Csnk1a1 and Egr1 in the common deleted region
  on chromosome 5 affects hematopoietic stem cells. Additionally, Trp53 was disrupted
