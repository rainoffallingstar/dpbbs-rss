description: Homing based on path integration (H-PI) is a form of navigation in which
  an animal uses self-motion cues to keep track of its position and return to a starting
  point. Despite evidence for a role of the hippocampus in homing behavior, the hippocampal
  spatial representations associated with H-PI are largely unknown. Here we developed
  a homing task (AutoPI task) that required a mouse to find a randomly placed lever
  on an arena before returning to its home base. Recordings from the CA1 area in ...
