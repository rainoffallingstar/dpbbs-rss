description: Porous organic cages (POCs) are meanwhile an established class of porous
  materials. Most of them are soluble to a certain extend and thus processable in
  or from solution. However, a few of larger salicylimine cages were reported to be
  insoluble in any organic solvents and thus characterized as amorphous materials.
  These cages were now synthesized as single-crystalline materials to get insight
  into packing motifs and preferred intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, the
