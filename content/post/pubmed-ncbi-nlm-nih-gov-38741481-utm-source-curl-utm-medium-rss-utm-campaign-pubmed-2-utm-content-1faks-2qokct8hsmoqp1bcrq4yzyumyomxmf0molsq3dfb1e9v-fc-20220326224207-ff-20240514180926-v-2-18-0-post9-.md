description: In this work, the chemical reduction of a hybrid pyracylene-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene
  (HPH) nanographene was investigated with different alkali metals (Na, K, Rb) to
  reveal its remarkable multielectron acceptor abilities. The UV-vis and ¹H NMR spectroscopy
  monitoring of the stepwise reduction reactions supports the existence of all intermediate
  reduction states up to the hexaanion for HPH. Tuning the experimental conditions
  enabled the synthesis of the HPH anions with gradually ...
