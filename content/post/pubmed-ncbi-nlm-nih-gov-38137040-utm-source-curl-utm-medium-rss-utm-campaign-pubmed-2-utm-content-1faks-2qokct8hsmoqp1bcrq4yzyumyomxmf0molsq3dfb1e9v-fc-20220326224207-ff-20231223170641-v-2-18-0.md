description: Glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA-1) is a rare but treatable autosomal-recessive
  neurometabolic disorder of lysin metabolism caused by biallelic pathogenic variants
  in glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase gene (GCDH) that lead to deficiency of GCDH protein.
  Without treatment, this enzyme defect causes a neurological phenotype characterized
  by movement disorder and cognitive impairment. Based on a comprehensive literature
  search, we established a large dataset of GCDH variants using the Leiden Open ...
