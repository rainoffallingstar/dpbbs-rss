description: Axial vascularization of tissue constructs is essential to maintain an
  adequate blood supply for a stable regeneration of a clinically relevant tissue
  size. The versatility of the arterio-venous loop (AVL) has been previously shown
  in various small and large animal models as well as in clinical reports for bone
  regeneration. We have previously demonstrated the capability of the AVL to induce
  axial vascularization and to support the nourishment of tissue constructs in small
  animal models ...
