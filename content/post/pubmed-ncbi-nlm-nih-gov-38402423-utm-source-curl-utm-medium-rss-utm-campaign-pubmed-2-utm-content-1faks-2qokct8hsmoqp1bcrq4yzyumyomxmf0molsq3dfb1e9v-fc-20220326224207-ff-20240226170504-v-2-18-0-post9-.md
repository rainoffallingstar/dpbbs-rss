description: MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI imaging) uniquely advances cancer
  research, by measuring spatial distribution of endogenous and exogenous molecules
  directly from tissue sections. These molecular maps provide valuable insights into
  basic and translational cancer research, including tumor biology, tumor microenvironment,
  biomarker identification, drug treatment, and patient stratification. Despite its
  advantages, MALDI imaging is underutilized in studying rare cancers. Sarcomas, a
