description: In pursuit of enhancing the stability of the highly explosive and shock-sensitive
  compound XeO(3), we performed quantum chemical calculations to investigate its possible
  complexation with electron-rich crown ethers, including 9-crown-3, 12-crown-4, 15-crown-5,
  18-crown-6, and 21-crown-7, as well as their thio analogues. Furthermore, we expanded
  our study to other noble gas trioxides (NgO(3)), namely, KrO(3) and ArO(3). The
  basis set superposition error (BSSE) corrected interaction energies ...
