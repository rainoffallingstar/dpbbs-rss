description: Spatially-resolved RNA profiling has now been widely used to understand
  cells' structural organizations and functional roles in tissues, yet it is challenging
  to reconstruct the whole spatial transcriptomes due to various inherent technical
  limitations in tissue section preparation and RNA capture and fixation in the application
  of the spatial RNA profiling technologies. Here, we introduce a graph-guided neural
  tensor decomposition (GNTD) model for reconstructing whole spatial transcriptomes
