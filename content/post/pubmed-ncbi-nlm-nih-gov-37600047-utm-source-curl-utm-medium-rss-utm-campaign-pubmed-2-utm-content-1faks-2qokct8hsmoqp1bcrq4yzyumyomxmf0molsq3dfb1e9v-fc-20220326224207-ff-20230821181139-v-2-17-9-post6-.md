description: Here, we present a patient with coronary artery disease and prior percutaneous
  coronary interventions. This patient had to discontinue taking multiple statins
  and ezetimibe due to intolerance with musculoskeletal complaints and nausea. Monotherapy
  with bempedoic acid was well tolerated and was exceptionally effective at lipid
  lowering, enabling patients to achieve the low-density lipoprotein target of <55
  mg/dl, as recommended by current guidelines. In addition, serial coronary ...
