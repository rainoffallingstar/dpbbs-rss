description: High-intensity femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser enable
  pump-probe experiments for the investigation of electronic and nuclear changes during
  light-induced reactions. On timescales ranging from femtoseconds to milliseconds
  and for a variety of biological systems, time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography
  (TR-SFX) has provided detailed structural data for light-induced isomerization,
  breakage or formation of chemical bonds and electron transfer^(1,2). However, ...
