description: The intricate interplay of anemia and iron overload under the pathophysiological
  umbrella of ineffective erythropoiesis in non-transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia
  (NTDT) results in a complex variety of clinical phenotypes that are challenging
  to diagnose and manage. In this How I Treat article, we use a clinical framework
  rooted in pathophysiology to present four common scenarios of patients with NTDT.
  Starting from practical considerations in the diagnosis of NTDT, we delineate our
