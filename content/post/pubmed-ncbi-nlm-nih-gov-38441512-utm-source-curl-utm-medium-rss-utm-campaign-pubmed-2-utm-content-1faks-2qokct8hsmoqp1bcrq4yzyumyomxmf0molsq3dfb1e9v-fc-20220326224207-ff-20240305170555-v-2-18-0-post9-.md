CONCLUSIONS: We describe the systematic development and validation of a therapeutically relevant, straightforward, robust and reproducible potency assay to measure the immunomodulatory capacity of MSCs in M1 macrophage-driven inflammation. The insights into the challenges and how they were addressed may also be helpful to developers of potency assays related to other cellular functions and clinical ...
