description: Sporadic giant cell granulomas (GCGs) of the jaws and cherubism-associated
  giant cell lesions share histopathological features and microscopic diagnosis alone
  can be challenging. Additionally, GCG can morphologically closely resemble other
  giant cell-rich lesions, including non-ossifying fibroma (NOF), aneurysmal bone
  cyst (ABC), giant cell tumour of bone (GCTB), and chondroblastoma. The epigenetic
  basis of these giant cell-rich tumours is unclear and DNA methylation profiling
  has been shown ...
