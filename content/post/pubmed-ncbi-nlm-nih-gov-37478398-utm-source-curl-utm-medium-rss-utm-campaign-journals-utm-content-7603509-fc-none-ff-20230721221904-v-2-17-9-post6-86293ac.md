description: 'Mechanistic studies of immune bone marrow failure are difficult due
  to the scarcity of residual cells, the involvement of multiple cell types, and the
  inherent complexities of hematopoiesis and immunity. Single cell genomic technologies
  and bioinformatic analyses allow extensive, multi-dimensional analysis of very limited
  number of cells. We review the emerging applications of single cell techniques,
  and early results related to disease pathogenesis: effector and target cell populations
