description: Myelofibrosis (MF) is a clonal malignancy frequently characterized by
  anemia and in 10%-20% of cases it can evolve into blast phase (BP). Anemia in MF
  is associated with reduced survival and -in primary MF- also with an increased probability
  of BP. Conventional treatments for anemia have limited effectiveness in MF. Within
  a dataset of 1752 MF subjects largely unexposed to ruxolitinib (RUX), BP incidence
  was 2.5% patients per year (p-y). This rate reached respectively 4.3% and 4.5% p-y
