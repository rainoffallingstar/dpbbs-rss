description: The development of miniaturized high-throughput in situ screening platforms
  capable of handling the entire process of drug synthesis to final screening is essential
  for advancing drug discovery in the future. In this study, an approach based on
  combinatorial solid-phase synthesis, enabling the efficient synthesis of libraries
  of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) in an array format is presented. This
  on-chip platform allows direct biological screening without the need for transfer
