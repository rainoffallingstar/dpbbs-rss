description: Strategy combining targeted therapies is effective in B-cell lymphomas
  such as mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but acquired resistances remain a recurrent
  issue. Herein, we performed integrative longitudinal genomic and single-cell RNA-seq
  analyses of MCL patients treated with targeted therapies against CD20, BCL2 and
  BTK (i.e., OAsIs trial). We revealed the emergence of subclones with a selective
  advantage against OAsIs combination in vivo and showed that resistant cells were
