description: A series of tetrahydro-β-carboline (THβC)-based hydroxamic acids were
  rationally designed and synthesized as novel selective HDAC6 inhibitors (sHDAC6is)
  by the application of scaffold hopping strategy. Several THβC analogues were highly
  potent (IC(50) < 5 nM) and selective against HDAC6 enzyme and exhibited good antiproliferative
  activity against human multiple myeloma (MM) cell. Molecular docking interpreted
  the structure activity relationship (SAR). Target engagement of HDAC6 was confirmed
