description: Adults and children easily distinguish between fine-grained variations
  in trustworthiness intensity based on facial appearance, but the developmental origins
  of this fundamental social skill are still debated. Using a fast periodic visual
  stimulation (FPVS) oddball paradigm coupled with electroencephalographic (EEG) recording,
  we investigated neural discrimination of morphed faces that adults perceive as low-
  and high-trustworthy in a sample of 6-month-old infants (N = 29; 56% male; M(age)
