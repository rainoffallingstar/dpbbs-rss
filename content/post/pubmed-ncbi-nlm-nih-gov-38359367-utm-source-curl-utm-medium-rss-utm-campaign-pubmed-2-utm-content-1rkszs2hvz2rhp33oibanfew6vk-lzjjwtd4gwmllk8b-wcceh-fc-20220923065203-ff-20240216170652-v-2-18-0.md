description: HCMBL is a precursor condition to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
  We have shown that among individuals with HCMBL the CLL-International Prognostic
  Index (CLL-IPI) is prognostic for time-to-first therapy (TTFT). Little is known
  about the prognostic impact of somatically mutated genes among individuals with
  HCMBL. We sequenced DNA from 371 HCMBL individuals using a targeted sequencing panel
  of 59 recurrently mutated genes in CLL to identify high-impact mutations. We compared
  the ...
