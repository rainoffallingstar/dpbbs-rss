description: T cell migration plays an essential role in the immune response and T
  cell-based therapies. It can be modulated by chemical and physical cues such as
  electric fields (EFs). The mechanisms underlying electrotaxis (cell migration manipulated
  by EFs) are not fully understood and systematic studies with immune cells are rare.
  In this in vitro study, we show that direct current EFs with strengths of physiologically
  occurring EFs (25-200 mV/mm) can guide the migration of primary human CD4^(+) ...
