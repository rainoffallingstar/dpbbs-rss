description: Most Prostate Specific Membrane Antigens (PSMAs) targeting small molecules
  accumulate in the salivary glands (SGs), raising concerns about SG toxicity, especially
  after repeated therapies or therapy with ^(225)Ac-labeled ligands. SG toxicity is
  assessed clinically by the severity of patient-reported xerostomia, but this parameter
  can be challenging to objectively quantify. Therefore, we explored the feasibility
  of using SG volume as a biomarker for toxicity. In 21 patients with ...
