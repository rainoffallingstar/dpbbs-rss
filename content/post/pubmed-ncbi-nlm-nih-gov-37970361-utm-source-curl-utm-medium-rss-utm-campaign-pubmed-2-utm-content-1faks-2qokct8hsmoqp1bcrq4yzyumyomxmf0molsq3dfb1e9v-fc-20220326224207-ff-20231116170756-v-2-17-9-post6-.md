description: Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common primary brain tumors in adults
  and associated with poor clinical outcomes due to therapy resistances and destructive
  growth. Interactions of cancer cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a
  pivotal role in therapy resistances and tumor progression. In this study, we investigate
  the functional dependencies between the discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) and the
  integrin family of cell adhesion molecules for the radioresponse of human ...
