description: Diatoms, the main eukaryotic phytoplankton of the polar marine regions,
  are essential for the maintenance of food chains specific to Arctic and Antarctic
  ecosystems, and are experiencing major disturbances under current climate change.
  As such, it is fundamental to understand the physiological mechanisms and associated
  molecular basis of their endurance during the long polar night. Here, using the
