description: Repair of lesions in the plasma membrane is key to sustaining cellular
  homeostasis. Cells maintain cytoplasmic as well as membrane-bound stores of repair
  proteins that can rapidly precipitate at the site of membrane lesions. However,
  little is known about the origins of lipids and proteins for resealing and repair
  of the plasma membrane. Here we study the dynamics of caveolar proteins after laser-induced
  lesioning of plasma membranes of mammalian C2C12 tissue culture cells and muscle
  cells ...
