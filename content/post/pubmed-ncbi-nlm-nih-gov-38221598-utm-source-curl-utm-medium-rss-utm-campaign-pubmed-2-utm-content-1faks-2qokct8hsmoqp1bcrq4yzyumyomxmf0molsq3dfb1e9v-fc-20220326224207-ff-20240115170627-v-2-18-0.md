description: Secretin is a key hormone of the intestinal phase of digestion which
  activates pancreatic, bile duct and Brunner gland HCO(3)^(-) secretion. Recently,
  the secretin receptor (SCTR) was also found in the basolateral membrane of the beta-intercalated
  cell (B-IC) of the collecting duct. Experimental addition of secretin triggers a
  pronounced activation of urinary HCO(3)^(-) excretion, which is fully dependent
  on key functional proteins of the B-IC, namely apical pendrin and CFTR and the ...
