  conditioning in the prospective randomized international EBMT RICMAC study in patients
  with myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) was comparable but longer follow up is lacking.
  Patients with MDS aged 18-65 years were randomized to receive MAC (N = 64) with
  busulfan/cyclophosphamide or RIC (n = 65) with busulfan/fludarabine followed by
  stem cell transplantation -(HCT) from HLA matched or mismatched donor. After a median
