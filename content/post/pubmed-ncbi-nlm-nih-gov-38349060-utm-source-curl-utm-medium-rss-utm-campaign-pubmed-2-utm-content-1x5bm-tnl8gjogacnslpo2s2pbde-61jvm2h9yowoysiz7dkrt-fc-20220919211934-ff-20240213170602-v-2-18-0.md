description: The recent development of deep learning methods have undoubtedly led
  to great improvement in various machine learning tasks, especially in prediction
  tasks. This type of methods have also been adapted to answer various problems in
  bioinformatics, including automatic genome annotation, artificial genome generation
  or phenotype prediction. In particular, a specific type of deep learning method,
