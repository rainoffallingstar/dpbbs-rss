description: SARIFA (Stroma AReactive Invasion Front Areas) has recently emerged as
  a promising histopathological biomarker for colon and gastric cancer. To elucidate
  the underlying tumor biology, we assessed SARIFA-status in tissue specimens from
  The-Cancer-Genome-Atlas (TCGA) cohorts COAD (colonic adenocarcinoma) and READ (rectal
  adenocarcinoma). For the final analysis, 207 CRC patients could be included, consisting
  of 69 SARIFA-positive and 138 SARIFA-negative cases. In this external validation
