description: Isomers close to doubly magic _{28}^{78}Ni_{50} provide essential information
  on the shell evolution and shape coexistence near the Z=28 and N=50 double shell
  closure. We report the excitation energy measurement of the 1/2^{+} isomer in _{30}^{79}Zn_{49}
  through independent high-precision mass measurements with the JYFLTRAP double Penning
  trap and with the ISOLTRAP multi-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer. We
  unambiguously place the 1/2^{+} isomer at 942(10) keV, slightly below ...
