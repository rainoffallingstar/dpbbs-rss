description: Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a major birth anomaly that often
  occurs with additional non-hernia-related malformations, and is then referred to
  as CDH+. While the impact of genetic alterations does not play a major role in isolated
  CDH, patients with CDH+ display mutations that are usually determined via array-based
  comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). We analyzed 43 patients with CDH+ between
  2012 and 2021 to identify novel specific mutations via aCGH associated with CDH+
