description: The host-microbiota co-metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is linked
  to increased cardiovascular risk but how its circulating levels are regulated remains
  unclear. We applied "explainable" machine learning, univariate, multivariate and
  mediation analyses of fasting plasma TMAO concentration and a multitude of phenotypes
  in 1,741 adult Europeans of the MetaCardis study. Here we show that next to age,
  kidney function is the primary variable predicting circulating TMAO, with ...
