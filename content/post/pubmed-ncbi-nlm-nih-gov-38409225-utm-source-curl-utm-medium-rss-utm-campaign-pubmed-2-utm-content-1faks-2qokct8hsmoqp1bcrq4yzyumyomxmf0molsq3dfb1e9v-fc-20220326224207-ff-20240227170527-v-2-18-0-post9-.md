description: Although long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) dominate the transcriptome, their
  functions are largely unexplored. The extensive overlap of lncRNAs with coding and
  regulatory sequences restricts their systematic interrogation by DNA-directed perturbation.
  Here we developed genome-scale lncRNA transcriptome screening using Cas13d/CasRx.
  We show that RNA targeting overcomes limitations inherent to other screening methods,
  thereby considerably expanding the explorable space of the lncRNAome. By ...
