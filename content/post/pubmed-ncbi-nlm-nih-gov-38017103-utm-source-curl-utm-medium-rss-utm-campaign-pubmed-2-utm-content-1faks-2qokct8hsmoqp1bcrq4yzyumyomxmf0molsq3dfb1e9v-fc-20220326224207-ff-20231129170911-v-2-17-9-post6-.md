description: Clinical outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated
  with demographic and genetic features. Although the associations of acquired genetic
  alterations with patients' sex have been recently analyzed, their impact on outcome
  of female and male patients has not yet been comprehensively assessed. We performed
  mutational profiling, cytogenetic and outcome analyses in 1726 adults with AML (749
  female and 977 male) treated on frontline Alliance for Clinical Trials in ...
