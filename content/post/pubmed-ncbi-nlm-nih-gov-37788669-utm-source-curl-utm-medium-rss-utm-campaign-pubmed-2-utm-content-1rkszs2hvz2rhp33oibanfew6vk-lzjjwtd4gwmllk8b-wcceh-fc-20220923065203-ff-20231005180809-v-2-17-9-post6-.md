description: MLL/KMT2A amplifications and translocations are prevalent in infant,
  adult, and therapy-induced leukemia. However, the molecular contributor(s) to these
  alterations are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that histone H3 lysine 9 mono- and
  di-methylation (H3K9me1/2) balance at the MLL/KMT2A locus regulates these amplifications
  and rearrangements. This balance is controlled by the crosstalk between lysine demethylase
  KDM3B and methyltransferase G9a/EHMT2. KDM3B depletion increases H3K9me1/2 levels
