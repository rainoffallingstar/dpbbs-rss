description: The importance of amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex
  (mPFC) for the integration of neural, endocrine, and affective stress processing
  was shown in healthy participants and patients with stress-related disorders. The
  present manuscript which reports on one study-arm of the LawSTRESS project, aimed
  at investigating the predictive value of acute stress responses in these regions
  for biopsychological consequences of chronic stress in daily life. The LawSTRESS
  project examined ...
