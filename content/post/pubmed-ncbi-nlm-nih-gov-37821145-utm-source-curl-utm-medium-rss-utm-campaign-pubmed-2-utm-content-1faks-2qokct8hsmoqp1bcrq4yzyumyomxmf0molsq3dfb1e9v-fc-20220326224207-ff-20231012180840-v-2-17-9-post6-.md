description: We present a case of a man in his 80s with an incidental posterior cerebral
  artery aneurysm encased within a lipoma. The literature surrounding the incidence
  and intricate relationship of lipomas to cerebral aneurysms is reviewed. Lipomas
  are proposed to be derived from maldifferentiated subarachnoid space. For this reason,
  lipomas are often associated with vascular malformations and may develop in conjunction
  with vascular malformations such as cerebral aneurysms. Hypothesised theories ...
