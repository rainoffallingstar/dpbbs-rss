description: Genes that drive the proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis
  of malignant cells have been identified for many human cancers^(1-4). Independent
  studies have identified cell death pathways that eliminate cells for the good of
  the organism^(5,6). The coexistence of cell death pathways with driver mutations
  suggests that the cancer driver could be rewired to activate cell death using chemical
  inducers of proximity (CIPs). Here we describe a new class of molecules ...
