description: Dedifferentiated and undifferentiated ovarian carcinomas (DDOC/UDOC)
  are rare neoplasms defined by the presence of an undifferentiated carcinoma. In
  this study, we detailed the clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical and molecular
  features of a series of DDOC/UDOC. We collected a multi-institutional cohort of
  23 DDOC/UDOC and performed immunohistochemistry for core SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable
  (SWI/SNF) complex proteins (ARID1A, ARID1B, SMARCA4 and SMARCB1), mismatch repair
  (MMR) ...
