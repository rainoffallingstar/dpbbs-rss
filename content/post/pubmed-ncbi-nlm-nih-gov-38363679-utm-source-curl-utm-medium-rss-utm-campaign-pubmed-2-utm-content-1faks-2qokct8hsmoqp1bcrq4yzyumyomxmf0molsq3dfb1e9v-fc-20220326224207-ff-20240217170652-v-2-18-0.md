description: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) induce host defense but can also
  induce exacerbated inflammatory responses. This raises the question of whether other
  mechanisms are also involved in early host defense. Using transcriptome analysis
  of disrupted transcripts in herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells, we find that
  HSV infection disrupts the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription network
  in neurons and epithelial cells. Importantly, HIF activation leads to control of
