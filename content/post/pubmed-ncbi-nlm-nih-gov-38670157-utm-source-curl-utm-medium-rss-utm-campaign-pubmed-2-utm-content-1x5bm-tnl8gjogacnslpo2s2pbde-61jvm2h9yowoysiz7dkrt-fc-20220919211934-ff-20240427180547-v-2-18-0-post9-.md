description: The interrelation and complementary nature of multi-omics data can provide
  valuable insights into the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying diseases. However,
  challenges such as limited sample size, high data dimensionality and differences
  in omics modalities pose significant obstacles to fully harnessing the potential
  of these data. The prior knowledge such as gene regulatory network and pathway information
  harbors useful gene-gene interaction and gene functional module information. ...
