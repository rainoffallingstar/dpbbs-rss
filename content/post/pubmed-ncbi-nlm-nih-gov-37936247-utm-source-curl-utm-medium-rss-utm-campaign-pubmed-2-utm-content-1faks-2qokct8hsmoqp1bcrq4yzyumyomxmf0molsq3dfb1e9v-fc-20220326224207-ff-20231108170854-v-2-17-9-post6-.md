description: Epithelial membrane protein 3 (EMP3) is an N-glycosylated tetraspanin
  with a putative trafficking function. It is highly expressed in isocitrate dehydrogenase-wild-type
  glioblastoma (IDH-wt GBM), and its high expression correlates with poor survival.
  However, the exact trafficking role of EMP3 and how it promotes oncogenic signaling
  in GBM remain unclear. Here, we show that EMP3 promotes EGFR/CDK2 signaling by regulating
  the trafficking and enhancing the stability of EGFR. BioID2-based ...
