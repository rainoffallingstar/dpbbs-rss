description: The antiviral DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B has been implicated as
  a source of mutation in many cancers. However, despite years of work, a causal relationship
  has yet to be established in vivo. Here, we report a murine model that expresses
  tumor-like levels of human APOBEC3B. Animals expressing full-body APOBEC3B appear
  to develop normally. However, adult males manifest infertility, and older animals
  of both sexes show accelerated rates of carcinogenesis, visual and molecular ...
