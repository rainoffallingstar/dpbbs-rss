description: Intramembrane proteolysis regulates important processes such as signaling
  and transcriptional and posttranslational abundance control of proteins with key
  functions in metabolic pathways. This includes transcriptional control of mevalonate
  pathway genes, thereby ensuring balanced biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids.
  Our work shows that, at high cholesterol levels, signal peptide peptidase (SPP)
  cleaves squalene synthase (SQS), an enzyme that defines the branching point ...
