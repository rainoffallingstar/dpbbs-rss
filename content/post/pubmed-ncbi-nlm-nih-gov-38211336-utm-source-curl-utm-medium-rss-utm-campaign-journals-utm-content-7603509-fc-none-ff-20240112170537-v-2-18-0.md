description: MicroRNA (miR)-145 has been reported to downregulate the expression of
  tissue factor and factor XI in vitro and decrease venous thrombus formation in animal
  models. However, the association between miR-145 and risk of future venous thromboembolism
  (VTE) in the general population remains unknown. We investigated the association
  between plasma levels of miR-145 and risk of future VTE in a case-cohort study.
  Incident VTE cases (n=510) and a subcohort (n=1890) were derived from the third
  survey ...
