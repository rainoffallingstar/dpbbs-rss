description: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is a highly lethal biliary epithelial
  cancer in the liver. Here, Laminin subunit gamma-2 (LAMC2) with important oncogenic
  roles in iCCA is discovered. In a total of 231 cholangiocarcinoma patients (82%
  of iCCA patients) across four independent cohorts, LAMC2 is significantly more abundant
  in iCCA tumor tissue compared to normal bile duct and non-tumor liver. Among 26.3%
  of iCCA patients, LAMC2 gene is amplified, contributing to its ...
