description: Lung cancer has been shown to be targetable by novel immunotherapies
  which reactivate the immune system and enable tumor cell killing. However, treatment
  failure and resistance to these therapies is common. Consideration of sex as a factor
  influencing therapy resistance is still rare. We hypothesize that the success of
  the treatment is impaired by the presence of the immunosuppressive pregnancy-associated
  glycoprotein glycodelin that is expressed in patients with non-small-cell lung ...
