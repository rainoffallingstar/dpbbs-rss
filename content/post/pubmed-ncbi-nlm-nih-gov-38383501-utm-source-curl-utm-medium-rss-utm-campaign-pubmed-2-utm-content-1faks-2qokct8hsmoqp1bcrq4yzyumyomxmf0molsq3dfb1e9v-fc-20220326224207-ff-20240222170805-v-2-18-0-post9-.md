description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the formation and reorganisation of
  the nervous system during the life cycle of O. fusiformis, an early-branching annelid.
  Despite its apparent neuroanatomical simplicity, this species has a diverse peptidergic
  nervous system, exhibiting morphological similarities with other annelids, particularly
  at the larval stages. Our work supports the importance of neuropeptides in animal
  nervous systems and highlights how neuropeptides are differentially used ...'
