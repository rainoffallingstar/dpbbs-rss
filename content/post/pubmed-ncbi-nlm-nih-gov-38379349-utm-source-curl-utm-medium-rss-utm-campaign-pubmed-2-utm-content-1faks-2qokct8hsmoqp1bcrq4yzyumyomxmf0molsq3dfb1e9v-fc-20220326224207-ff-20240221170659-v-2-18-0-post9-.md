description: This paper proposes a surveillance model for plant pests that can optimally
  allocate resources among survey tools with varying properties. While some survey
  tools are highly specific for the detection of a single pest species, others are
  more generalized. There is considerable variation in the cost and sensitivity of
  these tools, but there are no guidelines or frameworks for identifying which tools
  are most cost-effective when used in surveillance programs that target the detection
