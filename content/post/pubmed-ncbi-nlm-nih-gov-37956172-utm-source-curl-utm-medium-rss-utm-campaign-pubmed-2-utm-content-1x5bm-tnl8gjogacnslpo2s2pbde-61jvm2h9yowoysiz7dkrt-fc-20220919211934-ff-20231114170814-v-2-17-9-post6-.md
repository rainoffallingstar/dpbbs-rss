description: Although advances in single-cell technologies have enabled the characterization
  of multiple omics profiles in individual cells, extracting functional and mechanistic
  insights from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we present scapGNN,
  a graph neural network (GNN)-based framework that creatively transforms sparse single-cell
  profile data into the stable gene-cell association network for inferring single-cell
  pathway activity scores and identifying cell phenotype-associated ...
