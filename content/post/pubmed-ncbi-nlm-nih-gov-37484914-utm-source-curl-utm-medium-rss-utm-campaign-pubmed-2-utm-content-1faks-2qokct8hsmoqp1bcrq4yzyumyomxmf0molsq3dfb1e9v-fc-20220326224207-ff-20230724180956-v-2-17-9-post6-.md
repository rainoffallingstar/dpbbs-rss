description: Faithful chromosome segregation during cell division requires accurate
  mitotic spindle formation. As mitosis occurs rapidly within the cell cycle, the
  proteins involved in mitotic spindle assembly undergo rapid changes, including their
  interactions with other proteins. The proper localization of the HURP protein on
  the kinetochore fibers, in close proximity to chromosomes, is crucial for ensuring
  accurate congression and segregation of chromosomes. In this study, we employ photoactivation
