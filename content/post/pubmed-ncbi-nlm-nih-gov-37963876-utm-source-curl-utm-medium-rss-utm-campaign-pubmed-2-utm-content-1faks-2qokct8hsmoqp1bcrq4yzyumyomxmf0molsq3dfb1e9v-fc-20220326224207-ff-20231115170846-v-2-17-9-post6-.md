description: Environmental factors are the major contributor to the onset of immunological
  disorders such as ulcerative colitis. However, their identities remain unclear.
  Here, we discover that the amount of consumed L-Tryptophan (L-Trp), a ubiquitous
  dietary component, determines the transcription level of the colonic T cell homing
  receptor, GPR15, hence affecting the number of colonic FOXP3^(+) regulatory T (Treg)
  cells and local immune homeostasis. Ingested L-Trp is converted by host IDO1/2 enzymes,
