description: Some viruses are rarely transmitted orally or sexually despite their
  presence in saliva, breast milk, or semen. We previously identified that extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) in semen and saliva inhibit Zika virus infection. However, the antiviral
  spectrum and underlying mechanism remained unclear. Here we applied lipidomics and
  flow cytometry to show that these EVs expose phosphatidylserine (PS). By blocking
  PS receptors, targeted by Zika virus in the process of apoptotic mimicry, they ...
