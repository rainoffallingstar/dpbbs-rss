description: With the advances in immunogenomics, the majority of tumor-specific antigens
  were found to be recognized by T helper cells (T(H)Cs). This observation led to
  the development of long epitope vaccines in various cancers. Mechanistically, we
  are still gaining a deeper understanding of the mode of action of T(H)Cs as precision
  antitumor agonists. Here, we discuss the specific cellular mechanisms of T(H)C functions
  in glioma immunology and contextualize current advances in anti-glioma ...
