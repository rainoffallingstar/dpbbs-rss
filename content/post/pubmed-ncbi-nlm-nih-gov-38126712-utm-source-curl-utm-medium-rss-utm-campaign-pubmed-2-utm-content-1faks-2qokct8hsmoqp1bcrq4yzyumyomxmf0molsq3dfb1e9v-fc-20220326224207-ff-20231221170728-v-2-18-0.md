description: MST1, MST2, MST3, MST4, and YSK1 are conserved members of the mammalian
  sterile 20-like serine/threonine (MST) family that regulate cellular functions such
  as proliferation and migration. The MST3 isozyme plays a role in regulating cell
  growth and apoptosis, and its dysregulation has been linked to high-grade tumors.
  To date, there are no isoform-selective inhibitors that could be used for validating
  the role of MST3 in tumorigenesis. We designed a series of 3-aminopyrazole-based
