description: Modern taxonomic classification is often based on phylogenetic analyses
  of a few molecular markers, although single-gene studies are still common. Here,
  we leverage genome-scale molecular phylogenetics (phylogenomics) of species and
  populations to reconstruct evolutionary relationships in a dense data set of 710
  fungal genomes from the biomedically and technologically important genus Aspergillus.
  To do so, we generated a novel set of 1,362 high-quality molecular markers specific
