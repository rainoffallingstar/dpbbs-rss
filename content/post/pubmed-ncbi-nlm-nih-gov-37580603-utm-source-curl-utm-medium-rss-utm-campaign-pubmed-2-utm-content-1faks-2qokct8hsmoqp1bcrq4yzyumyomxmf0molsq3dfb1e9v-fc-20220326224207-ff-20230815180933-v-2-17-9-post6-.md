description: Omnivorous animals, including mice and humans, tend to prefer energy-dense
  nutrients rich in fat over plant-based diets, especially for short periods of time,
  but the health consequences of this short-term consumption of energy-dense nutrients
  are unclear. Here, we show that short-term reiterative switching to 'feast diets',
  mimicking our social eating behavior, breaches the potential buffering effect of
  the intestinal microbiota and reorganizes the immunological architecture ...
