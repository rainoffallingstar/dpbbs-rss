description: RNA viruses have been shown to express various short RNAs, some of which
  have regulatory roles during replication, transcription, and translation of viral
  genomes. However, short viral RNAs generated from SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 genomic
  RNAs remained largely unexplored, possibly due limitations of the widely used library
  preparation methods for small RNA deep sequencing and corresponding data processing.
  By analyzing publicly available small RNA sequencing datasets, we observed that
