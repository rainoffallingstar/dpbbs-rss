description: Primary induction failure (PIF) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients
  is associated with poor outcome, with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HCT) being the sole curative therapeutic option. Here, we retrospectively evaluated
  long-term outcomes of 220 AML patients undergoing allogeneic HCT after PIF who never
  achieved remission, and identified clinical and molecular risk factors associated
  with treatment response and ultimate prognosis. In this high-risk ...
