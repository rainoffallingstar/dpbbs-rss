description: Metastasis arises from disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) that are characterized
  by intrinsic phenotypic plasticity and the capability of seeding to secondary organs.
  DTCs can remain latent for years before giving rise to symptomatic overt metastasis.
  In this context, DTCs fluctuate between a quiescent and proliferative state in response
  to systemic and microenvironmental signals including immune-mediated surveillance.
  Despite its relevance, how intrinsic mechanisms sustain DTCs plasticity has ...
