description: The recent advances of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have enabled
  reliable profiling of gene expression at the single-cell level, providing opportunities
  for accurate inference of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) on scRNA-seq data. Most
  methods for inferring GRNs suffer from the inability to eliminate transitive interactions
  or necessitate expensive computational resources. To address these, we present a
  novel method, termed GMFGRN, for accurate graph neural network (GNN)-based ...
