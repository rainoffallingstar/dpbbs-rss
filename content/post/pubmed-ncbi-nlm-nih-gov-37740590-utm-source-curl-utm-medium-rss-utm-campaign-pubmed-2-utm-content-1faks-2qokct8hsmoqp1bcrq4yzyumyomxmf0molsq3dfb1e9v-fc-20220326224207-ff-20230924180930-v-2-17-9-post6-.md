description: A crude methanol extract of the roots of Allochrusa gypsophiloides (syn.
  Acanthophyllum gypsophiloides) (collected from the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan)
  was chemically characterised by UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. The results indicate
  the presence of six major bisdesmosidic saponins derived from gypsogenin, gypsogenic
  and quillaic acids, including five compounds reported for the first time for this
  species. The chloroform, methanol and water extracts of A. gypsophiloides showed
