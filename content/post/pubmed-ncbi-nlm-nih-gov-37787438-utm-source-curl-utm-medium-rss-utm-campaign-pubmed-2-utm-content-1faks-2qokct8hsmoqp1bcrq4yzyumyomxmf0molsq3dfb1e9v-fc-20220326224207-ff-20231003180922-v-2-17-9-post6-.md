  N = 20 adults (Experiment 1), N = 21 five to six-year-old children (Experiment 2),
  and N = 140 four-, seven-, and eleven-month-old infants (Experiment 3; all predominantly
  White, 81 females, data collected in 2013-2020) participated in a fast periodic

  and furniture stimuli emerged in children and adults, with responses much reduced
