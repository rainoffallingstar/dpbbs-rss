description: We present the measurements of individual bound electron g factors of
  ^{20}Ne^{9+} and ^{22}Ne^{9+} on the relative level of 0.1 parts per billion. The
  comparison with theory represents the most stringent test of bound-state QED in
  strong electric fields. A dedicated mass measurement results in m(^{20}Ne)=19.992
  440 168 77(9) u, which improves the current literature value by a factor of 18,
  disagrees by 4 standard deviations, and represents the most precisely measured mass
  value in atomic ...
