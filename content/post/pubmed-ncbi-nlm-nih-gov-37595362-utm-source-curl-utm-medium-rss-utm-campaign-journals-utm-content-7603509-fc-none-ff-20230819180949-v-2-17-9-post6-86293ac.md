  most notably in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. However, the function of PPM1D
  in hematopoiesis and its contribution to tumor cell growth remain incompletely understood.
  Using conditional mouse models, we uncover a central role for Ppm1d in hematopoiesis
  and validate its potential as a therapeutic target. We find that Ppm1d regulates
