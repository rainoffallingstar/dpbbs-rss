description: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and prolonged exposure to PD fluids (PDF) induce
  peritoneal membrane (PM) fibrosis and hypervascularity, leading to functional PM
  degeneration. 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) has shown potential as PM antifibrotic by inhibiting
  hyper-glycolysis induced mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT). We investigated
  whether administration of 2-DG with several PDF affects the permeability of mesothelial
  and endothelial barrier of the PM. The antifibrotic effect of 2-DG was ...
