description: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a generally incurable malignancy that originates
  from developmentally blocked germinal center (GC) B cells residing, primarily, within
  lymph nodes (LNs). During the long natural history of FL, malignant B cells often
  disseminate to multiple LNs and can affect virtually any organ. Non-malignant LNs
  are highly organized structures distributed throughout the body where they perform
  functions critical for host defense. In FL, the malignant B cells "re-educate" ...
