description: Fine-mapping and functional studies implicate rs117701653, a non-coding
  single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD28/CTLA4/ICOS locus, as a risk variant for
  rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes. Here, using DNA pulldown, mass spectrometry,
  genome editing and eQTL analysis, we establish that the disease-associated risk
  allele is functional, reducing affinity for the inhibitory chromosomal regulator
  SMCHD1 to enhance expression of inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) in memory CD4^(+)
