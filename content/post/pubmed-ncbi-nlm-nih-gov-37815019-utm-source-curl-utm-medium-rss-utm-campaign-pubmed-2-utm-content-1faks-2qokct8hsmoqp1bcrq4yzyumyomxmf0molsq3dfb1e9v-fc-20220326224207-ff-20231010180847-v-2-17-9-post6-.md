description: Novel redox-active hexaguanidine molecules with multiple redox states
  were synthesized by connecting three o-diguanidinobenzene units. In 2,3,6,7,14,15-hexaguanidino-triptycenes,
  the three redox-active o-diguanidinobenzene units are connected through C-C bonds
  to the sp3-hybridized bridgehead C atoms, and in 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaguanidino-triphenylenes
  they are directly connected. The connectivity difference leads to different electronic
  coupling between the three redox-active o-diguanidinobenzene... ...
