description: Walking on unknown and rough terrain is challenging for (bipedal) robots,
  while humans naturally cope with perturbations. Therefore, human strategies serve
  as an excellent inspiration to improve the robustness of robotic systems. Neuromusculoskeletal
  (NMS) models provide the necessary interface for the validation and transfer of
  human control strategies. Reflexes play a crucial part during normal locomotion
  and especially in the face of perturbations, and provide a simple, transferable,
