description: 'CONCLUSION: Our case seeks to demonstrate a novel case whereby a bone
  marrow aspirate culture provided a conclusive diagnosis of invasive Candida parapsilosis
  bone marrow infection, and guided treatment in an immunocompetent patient. It is
  important for clinicians to consider invasive fungal infections in febrile patients
  regardless of immune status. Additionally, when performing a bone marrow aspirate
  and trephine on a febrile patient, we recommend including aspirate fungal cultures
