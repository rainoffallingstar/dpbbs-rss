description: Studies of structural changes in mAbs under forced stress and storage
  conditions are essential for the recognition of degradation hotspots, which can
  be further remodeled to improve the stability of the respective protein. Herein,
  we used diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-based covalent labeling mass spectrometry (CL-MS)
  to assess structural changes in a model mAb (SILuMAb). Structural changes in the
  heat-stressed mAb samples were confirmed at specific amino acid positions from the
  DEPC label ...
