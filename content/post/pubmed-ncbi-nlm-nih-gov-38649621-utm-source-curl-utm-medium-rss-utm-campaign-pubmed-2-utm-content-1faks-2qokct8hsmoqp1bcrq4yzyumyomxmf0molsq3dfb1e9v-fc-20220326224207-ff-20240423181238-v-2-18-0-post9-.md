description: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer characterized by neuroendocrine
  differentiation. Its carcinogenesis is based either on the integration of the Merkel
  cell polyomavirus or on ultraviolet (UV) mutagenesis, both of which lead to high
  immunogenicity either through the expression of viral proteins or neoantigens. Despite
  this immunogenicity resulting from viral or UV-associated carcinogenesis, it exhibits
  highly aggressive behavior. However, owing to the rarity of MCC and the lack ...
