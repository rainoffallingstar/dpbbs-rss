description: Although virtual-reality exposure treatment (VRET) for anxiety disorders
  is an efficient treatment option for specific phobia, mechanisms of action for immediate
  and sustained treatment response need to be elucidated. Towards this aim, core therapy
  process variables were assessed as predictors for short- and long-term VR treatment
  outcomes. In a bi-centric study, n = 186 patients with spider phobia completed a
  baseline-assessment, a one-session VRET, a post-therapy assessment, and ...
