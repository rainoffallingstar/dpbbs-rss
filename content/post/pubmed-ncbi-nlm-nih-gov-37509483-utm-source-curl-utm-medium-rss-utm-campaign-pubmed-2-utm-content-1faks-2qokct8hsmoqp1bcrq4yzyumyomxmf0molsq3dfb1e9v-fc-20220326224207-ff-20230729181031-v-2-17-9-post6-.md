description: 'The aim of our study was to compare the features of macrophage (mf)
  composition of the kidneys in patients with fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and
  in patients without cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We used kidney fragments taken
  during autopsy. Macrophage infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry: antibodies
  CD68 were used as a common mf marker, CD80-M1 type mf marker, CD163, CD206, and
  stabilin-1-M2 type. Macrophage composition of the kidneys in patients with fatal
  MI ...'
