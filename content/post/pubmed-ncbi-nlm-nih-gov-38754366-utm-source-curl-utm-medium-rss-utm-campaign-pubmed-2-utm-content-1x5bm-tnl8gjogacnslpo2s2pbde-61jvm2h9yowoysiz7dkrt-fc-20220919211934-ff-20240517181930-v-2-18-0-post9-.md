  RNA velocity, have the potential to reveal causal links between transcription factors
  (TFs) and their target genes in gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, existing
  methods either overlook these expression dynamics or necessitate that cells be ordered
  along a linear pseudotemporal axis, which is incompatible with branching trajectories.
