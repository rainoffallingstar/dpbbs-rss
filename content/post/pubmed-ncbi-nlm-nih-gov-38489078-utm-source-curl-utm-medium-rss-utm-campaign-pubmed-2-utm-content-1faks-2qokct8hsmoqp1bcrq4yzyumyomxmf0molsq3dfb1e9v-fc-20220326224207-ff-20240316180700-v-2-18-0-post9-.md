description: For sufficiently low biases, Ohm's law, the cornerstone of electricity,
  stating that current I and voltage V are proportional, is satisfied at low biases
  for all known systems ranging from macroscopic conductors to nanojunctions. In this
  study, we predict theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that in single-molecule
  junctions fabricated with single-layer graphene as electrodes the current at low
  V scales as the cube of V, thereby invalidating Ohm's law. The absence of the ohmic
  regime ...
