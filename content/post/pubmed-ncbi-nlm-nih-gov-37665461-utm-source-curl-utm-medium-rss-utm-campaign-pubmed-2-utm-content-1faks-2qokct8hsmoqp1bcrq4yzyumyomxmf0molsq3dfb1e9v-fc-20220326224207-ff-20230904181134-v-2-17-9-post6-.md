description: Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is a rapidly maturing discipline,
  thus gaining momentum for routine molecular profiling of clinical specimens to improve
  disease classification, diagnostics, and therapy development. Yet, hurdles need
  to be overcome to enhance reproducibility in preanalytical sample processing, especially
  in large, quantity-limited sample cohorts. Therefore, automated sonication and single-pot
  solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (autoSP3) was developed as a ...
