description: Clustering Epilepsy (CE) is an epileptic disorder with neurological comorbidities
  caused by heterozygous variants of the X chromosome gene Protocadherin 19 (PCDH19).
  Recent studies have implicated dysregulation of the Nuclear Hormone Receptor (NHR)
  pathway in CE pathogenesis. To obtain a comprehensive overview of the impact and
  mechanisms of loss of PCDH19 function in CE pathogenesis, we have performed epigenomic,
  transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of CE relevant models. Our ...
