description: Preclinical evidence has suggested an interplay between the androgen
  receptor, which largely drives the growth of prostate cancer cells, and poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase. This association provides a rationale for their co-inhibition for the
  treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), an area of
  unmet medical need. The phase 3 TALAPRO-2 study investigated combining the poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase inhibitor talazoparib with enzalutamide versus enzalutamide alone ...
