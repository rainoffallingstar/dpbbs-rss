  smear microscopy and culture, cannot accurately predict poor treatment outcomes.
  Research into new TB treatment monitoring tools (TMT) is growing, but data are unreliable.
  In this document, we aim to provide guidance for studies investigating and evaluating
  TB TMT for use during routine clinical care. Here, a TB TMT would guide treatment
