description: Radical control of malaria likely requires a vaccine that targets both
  the asymptomatic liver stages and the disease-causing blood stages of the human
  malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. While substantial progress has been made
  towards liver stage vaccines, the development of a blood stage vaccine is lagging
  behind. We have recently conducted a first-in-human clinical trial to evaluate the
  safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant, full-length merozoite surface protein
