description: The DNA damage response (DDR) acts as a barrier to malignant transformation
  and is often impaired during tumorigenesis. Exploiting the impaired DDR can be a
  promising therapeutic strategy; however, the mechanisms of inactivation and corresponding
  biomarkers are incompletely understood. Starting from an unbiased screening approach,
  we identified the SMC5-SMC6 Complex Localization Factor 2 (SLF2) as a regulator
  of the DDR and biomarker for a B-cell lymphoma (BCL) patient subgroup with an ...
