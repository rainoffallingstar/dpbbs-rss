description: The modulation of macrophage phenotype from a pro-inflammatory to an
  anti-inflammatory state holds therapeutic potential in the treatment of inflammatory
  disease. We have previously shown that arginase-2 (Arg2), a mitochondrial enzyme,
  is a key regulator of the macrophage anti-inflammatory response. Here, we investigate
  the therapeutic potential of Arg2 enhancement via target site blockers (TSBs) in
  human macrophages. TSBs are locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides that
