description: The cancer genomics revolution has served up a plethora of promising
  and challenging targets for the drug discovery community. The field of targeted
  protein degradation (TPD) uses small molecules to reprogram the protein homeostasis
  system to destroy desired target proteins. In the last decade, remarkable progress
  has enabled the rational development of degraders for a large number of target proteins,
  with over 20 molecules targeting more than 12 proteins entering clinical development.
