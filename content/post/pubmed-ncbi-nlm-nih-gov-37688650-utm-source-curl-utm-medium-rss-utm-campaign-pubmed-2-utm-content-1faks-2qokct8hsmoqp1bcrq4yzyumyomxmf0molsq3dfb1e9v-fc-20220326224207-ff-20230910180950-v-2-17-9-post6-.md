description: 'This paper is a cross fertilization of ideas about the importance of
  molecular aspects of breast cancer metastasis by basic scientists, a pathologist,
  and clinical oncologists at the Henry Ford Health symposium. We address four major
  topics: (i) the complex roles of lymphatic endothelial cells and the molecules that
  stimulate them to enhance lymph node and systemic metastasis and influence the anti-tumor
  immunity that might inhibit metastasis; (ii) the interaction of molecules and cells
