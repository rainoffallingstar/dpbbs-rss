description: The newly characterized sperm-specific Na^(+)/H^(+) exchanger stands
  out by its unique tripartite domain composition^(1,2). It unites a classical solute
  carrier unit with regulatory domains usually found in ion channels, namely, a voltage-sensing
  domain and a cyclic-nucleotide binding domain^(1,3), which makes it a mechanistic
  chimera and a secondary-active transporter activated strictly by membrane voltage.
