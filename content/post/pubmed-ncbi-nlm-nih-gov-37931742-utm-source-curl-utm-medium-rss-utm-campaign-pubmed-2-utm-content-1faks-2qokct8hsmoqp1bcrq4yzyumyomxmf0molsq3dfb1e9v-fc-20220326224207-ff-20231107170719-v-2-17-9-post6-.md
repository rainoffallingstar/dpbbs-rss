description: Microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like (MASTL) (or Greatwall
  kinase (GWL)) is an important cell cycle regulating kinase that regulates the G2-M
  transition. Uncontrolled MASTL activity is implicated in breast cancer progression.
  To date, very few inhibitors have been reported against this protein. Here, structure-based
  computational modeling indicates that the natural product flavopiridol (FLV) binds
  strongly to MASTL and these results are validated using molecular ...
