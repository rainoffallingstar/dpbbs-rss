description: In mammalian neocortex development, every cohort of newborn neurons is
  guided toward the marginal zone, leading to an "inside-out" organization of the
  6 neocortical layers. This migratory pattern is regulated by the extracellular glycoprotein
  Reelin. The reeler mouse shows a homozygous mutation of the reelin gene. Using RNA
  in situ hybridization we could demonstrate that the Reelin-deficient mouse cortex
  (male and female) displays an increasing lamination defect along the rostro-caudal
  axis ...
