description: The prognostic impact of achieving and in particular maintaining MRD
  negativity in multiple myeloma is now established, therefore identifying among MRD-negative
  patients the ones at higher risk of losing MRD negativity is of importance. We analyzed
  predictors of unsustained MRD-negativity in patients enrolled in the FORTE trial
  (NCT02203643). MRD was performed by multiparameter flow-cytometry (sensitivity of
  10-5) at premaintenance and every 6 months thereafter. The cumulative incidence
