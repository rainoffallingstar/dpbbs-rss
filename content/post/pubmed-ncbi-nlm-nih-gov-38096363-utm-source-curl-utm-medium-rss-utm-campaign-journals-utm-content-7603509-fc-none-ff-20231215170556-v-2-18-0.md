description: To establish a strict p53-dependent gene expression profile, TP53-/-
  clones were derived from TP53+/+ and TP53-/mut t(4;14) human myeloma cell lines
  (HMCLs) using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. From the 17 dysregulated genes shared between
  the TP53-/- clones from TP53+/+ HMCLs, we established a functional p53 score, involving
  13 genes specifically downregulated upon p53 silencing. This functional score segregated
  clones and myeloma cell lines, as well as other cancer cell lines according to their
