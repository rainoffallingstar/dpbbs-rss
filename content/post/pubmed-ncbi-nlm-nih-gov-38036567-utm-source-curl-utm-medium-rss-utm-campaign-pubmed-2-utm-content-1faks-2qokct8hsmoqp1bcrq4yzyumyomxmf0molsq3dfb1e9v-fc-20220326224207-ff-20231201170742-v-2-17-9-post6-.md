description: Coronavirus replication is associated with the remodeling of cellular
  membranes, resulting in the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). A DMV-spanning
  pore was identified as a putative portal for viral RNA. However, the exact components
  and the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 DMV pore remain to be determined. Here, we investigate
  the structure of the DMV pore by in situ cryo-electron tomography combined with
  subtomogram averaging. We identify non-structural protein (nsp) 3 and 4 as ...
