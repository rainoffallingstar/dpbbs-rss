  impairment, often require an intensive care unit (ICU) stay and have a high risk
  of mortality. Hence, useful biomarkers for early detection of SAD are urgently needed.
  Extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their cargo are known to maintain normal physiology
  but also have been linked to numerous disease states. Here, we sought to identify
  differentially expressed proteins in plasma EVs from SAD patients as potential biomarkers
