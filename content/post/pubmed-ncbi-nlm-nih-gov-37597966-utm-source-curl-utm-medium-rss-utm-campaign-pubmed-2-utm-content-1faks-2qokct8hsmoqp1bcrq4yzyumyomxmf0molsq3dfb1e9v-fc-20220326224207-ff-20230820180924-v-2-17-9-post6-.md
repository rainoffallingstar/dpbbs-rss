description: Rumination has been proposed as an important risk factor for depression,
  whereas mindful attention is considered a protective form of self-focusing. Experimental
  studies have demonstrated differential effects of these modes when induced in the
  lab. However, their impact on daily life processes is poorly understood, particularly
  in individuals vulnerable to depressive relapses. The aim of our study was to examine
  short- and longer-term effects of repeated brief rumination and mindful ...
