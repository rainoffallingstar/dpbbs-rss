description: To regulate expression, enhancers must come in proximity to their target
  gene. However, the relationship between the timing of enhancer-promoter (E-P) proximity
  and activity remains unclear, with examples of uncoupled, anticorrelated and correlated
  interactions. To assess this, we selected 600 characterized enhancers or promoters
  with tissue-specific activity in Drosophila embryos and performed Capture-C in FACS-purified
  myogenic or neurogenic cells during specification and ...
