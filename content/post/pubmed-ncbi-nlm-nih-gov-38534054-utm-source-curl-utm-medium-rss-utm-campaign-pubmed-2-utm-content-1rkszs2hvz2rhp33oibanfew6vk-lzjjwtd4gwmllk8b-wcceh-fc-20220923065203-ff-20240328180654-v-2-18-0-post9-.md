description: Orbital plasmacytoma is a rare plasma cell tumor that may arise as an
  aggressive form of extramedullary multiple myeloma. Treatment modalities include
  surgical excision, radiation, and chemotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell
  therapy is currently reserved for refractory disease. The authors present a case
  of a 69-year-old woman with an extensive orbital plasmacytoma refractory to multimodal
  therapy who was treated with idecabtagene vicleucel chimeric antigen receptor T
  cell therapy. ...
