description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Dl can activate the Notch pathway
  without ubi of its ICD. It signals via three modes. Ubi is specifically required
  for the Mib1-dependent processes and the adjustment of cis-inhibition. In contrast
  to Mib1, Neur can efficiently activate Dl without ubi. Neur probably acts as an
  endocytic co-adapter in addition to its role as E3 ligase. Endocytosis, regulated
  in a ubi-dependent or ubi-independent manner is required for signalling and also
  suppression ...'
