description: Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system
  (CNS), are generated from oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) that express neurotransmitter
  receptors. However, the mechanisms that affect OPC activity in vivo and the physiological
  roles of neurotransmitter signaling in OPCs are unclear. In this study, we generated
  a transgenic mouse line that expresses membrane-anchored GCaMP6s in OPCs and used
  longitudinal two-photon microscopy to monitor OPC calcium (Ca^(2+)) ...
