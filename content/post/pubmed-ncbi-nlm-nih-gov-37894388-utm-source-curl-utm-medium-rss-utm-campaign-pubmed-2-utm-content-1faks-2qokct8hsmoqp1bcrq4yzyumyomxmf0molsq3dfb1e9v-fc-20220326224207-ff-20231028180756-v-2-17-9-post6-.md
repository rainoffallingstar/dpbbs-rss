description: Skull-base chordoma and chondrosarcoma are rare radioresistant tumors
  treated with surgical resection and/or radiotherapy. Because of the established
  dosimetric and biological benefits of heavy particle therapy, we performed a systematic
  and evidence-based review of the clinical outcomes of patients with skull-base chordoma
  and chondrosarcoma treated with carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). A literature review
  was performed using a MEDLINE search of all articles to date. We identified 227
