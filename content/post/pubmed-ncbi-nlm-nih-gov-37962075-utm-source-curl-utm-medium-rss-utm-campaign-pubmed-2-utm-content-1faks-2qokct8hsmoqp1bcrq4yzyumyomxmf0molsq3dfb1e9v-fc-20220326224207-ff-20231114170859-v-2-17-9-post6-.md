description: The chemical biology of native nucleic acid modifications has seen an
  intense upswing, first concerning DNA modifications in the field of epigenetics
  and then concerning RNA modifications in a field that was correspondingly rebaptized
  epitranscriptomics by analogy. The German Research Foundation (DFG) has funded several
  consortia with a scientific focus in these fields, strengthening the traditionally
  well-developed nucleic acid chemistry community and inciting it to team up with
