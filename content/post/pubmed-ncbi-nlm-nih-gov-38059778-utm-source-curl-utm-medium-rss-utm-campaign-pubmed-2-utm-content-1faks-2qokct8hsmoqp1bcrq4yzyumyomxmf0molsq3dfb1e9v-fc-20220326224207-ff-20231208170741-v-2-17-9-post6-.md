description: Compounds with multiple photoswitching units are appealing for complex
  photochemical control of molecular materials and nanostructures. Herein, we synthesized
  novel meta- and para- connected (related to the nitrogen of the indoline) azobenzene-spiropyran
  dyads, in which the central benzene unit is shared by both switches. We investigated
  their photochemistry using static and time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy
  as well as quantum chemical calculations. In the meta-compound, ...
