description: CD8 T lymphocytes are classically viewed as cytotoxic T cells. Whether
  human CD8 T cells can, in parallel, induce a tissue regeneration program is poorly
  understood. Here, antigen-specific assay systems revealed that human CD8 T cells
  not only mediated cytotoxicity but also promoted tissue remodeling. Activated CD8
  T cells could produce the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-ligand amphiregulin
  (AREG) and sensitize epithelial cells for enhanced regeneration potential. Blocking
