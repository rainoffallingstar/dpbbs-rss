description: Liquid crystals have found a wide area of application over the last few
  decades, proving to be excellent materials for tunable optics from visible to near-infrared
  frequencies. Currently, much effort is devoted to demonstrating their applicability
  at THz frequencies (1-10 THz), where tremendous advances of broadband and intense
  sources have been achieved. Yet, a detailed understanding of THz-triggered dynamics
  in liquid crystals is incomplete. Here, we perform broadband THz time ...
