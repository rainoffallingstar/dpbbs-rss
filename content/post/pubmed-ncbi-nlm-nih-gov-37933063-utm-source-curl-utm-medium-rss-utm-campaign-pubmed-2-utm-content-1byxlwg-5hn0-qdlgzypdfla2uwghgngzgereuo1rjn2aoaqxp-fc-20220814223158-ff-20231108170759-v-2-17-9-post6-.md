description: Sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) is a crucial predictor for breast
  cancer treatment and survival. This study was designed to propose deep learning
  (DL) models based on grayscale ultrasound, color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), and
  elastography images, and to evaluate how DL radiomics can be used to classify SLNM
  in breast cancer. Clinical and ultrasound data of 317 patients diagnosed with breast
  cancer at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were collected from
