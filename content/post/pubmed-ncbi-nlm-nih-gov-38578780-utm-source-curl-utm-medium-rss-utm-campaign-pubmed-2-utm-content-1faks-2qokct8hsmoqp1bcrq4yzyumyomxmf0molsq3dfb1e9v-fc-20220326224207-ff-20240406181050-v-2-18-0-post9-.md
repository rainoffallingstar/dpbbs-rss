description: Mast cells are effector cells known to contribute to allergic airway
  disease. When activated, mast cells release a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators,
  including the mast cell-specific protease carboxypeptidase A3 (CPA3). The expression
  of CPA3 in the airway epithelium and lumen of asthma patients has been associated
  with a Th2-driven airway inflammation. However, the role of CPA3 in asthma is unclear
  and therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of CPA3 for ...
