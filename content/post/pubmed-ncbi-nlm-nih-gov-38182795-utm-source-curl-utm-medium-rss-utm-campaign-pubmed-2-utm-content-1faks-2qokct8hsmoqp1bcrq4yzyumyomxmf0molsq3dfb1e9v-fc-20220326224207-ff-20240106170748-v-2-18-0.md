description: The therapeutic use of adeno-associated viral vector (AAV)-mediated gene
  disruption using CRISPR-Cas9 is limited by potential off-target modifications and
  the risk of uncontrolled integration of vector genomes into CRISPR-mediated double-strand
  breaks. To address these concerns, we explored the use of AAV-delivered paired Staphylococcus
  aureus nickases (D10ASaCas9) to target the Hao1 gene for the treatment of primary
  hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1). Our study demonstrated effective Hao1 ...
