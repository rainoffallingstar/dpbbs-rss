description: In this paper, we report results on the electronic structure and transport
  properties of molecular junctions fabricated via conducting probe atomic force microscopy
  (CP-AFM) using self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of n-alkyl chains anchored with
  acetylene groups (CnA; n = 8, 9, 10, and 12) on Ag, Au, and Pt electrodes. We found
  that the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of CnA CP-AFM junctions can be very
  accurately reproduced by the same off-resonant single-level model (orSLM) ...
