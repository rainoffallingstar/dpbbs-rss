description: Transcriptomic evidence from human myocardium in myocardial infarction
  (MI) is still not sufficient. Thus, there is a need for studies on human cardiac
  samples in relation to the clinical data of patients. The purpose of our pilot study
  was to investigate the transcriptomic profile of myocardium in the infarct zone,
  in comparison to the remote myocardium, in patients with fatal MI, via microarray
  analysis. This study included four patients with fatal MI type 1. We selected ...
