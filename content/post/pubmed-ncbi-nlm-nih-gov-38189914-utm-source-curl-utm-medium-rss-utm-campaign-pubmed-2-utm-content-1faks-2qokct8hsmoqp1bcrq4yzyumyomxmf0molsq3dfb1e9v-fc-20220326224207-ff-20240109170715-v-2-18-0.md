description: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of Electrical
  Cardiometry (EC)-derived cardiac output indexed to weight (CO) and its changes during
  the first 48 h in relation to adverse short-term outcome in very preterm infants.
  In this prospective observational study of preterm infants < 32 weeks gestational
  age (GA), the combined adverse outcome was defined as mortality or abnormal cranial
  ultrasound (any grade intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or periventricular leukomalacia)
