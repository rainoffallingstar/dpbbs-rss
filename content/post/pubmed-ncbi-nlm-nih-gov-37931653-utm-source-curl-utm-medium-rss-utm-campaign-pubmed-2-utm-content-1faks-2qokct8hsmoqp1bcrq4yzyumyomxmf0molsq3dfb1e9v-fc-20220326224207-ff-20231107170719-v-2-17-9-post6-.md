description: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the leading causes to develop
  end-stage kidney disease worldwide. Pericytes are implicated in the development
  of tissue fibrosis. However, the underlying mechanisms of pericytes in DKD remain
  largely unknown. We isolated and cultured primary pericytes and rat mesangial cells
  (HBZY-1). Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis were used to explore the role and regulatory
  mechanism of Integrin β8/transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) pathway. We
