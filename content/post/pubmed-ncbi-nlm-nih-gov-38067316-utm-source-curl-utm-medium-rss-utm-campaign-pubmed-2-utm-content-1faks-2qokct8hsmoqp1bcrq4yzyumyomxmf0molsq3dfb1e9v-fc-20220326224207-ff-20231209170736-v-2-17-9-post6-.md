description: Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy
  (ALPPS) is a two-stage procedure that can potentially cure patients with large cholangiocarcinoma.
  The current study evaluates the impact of modifications on the outcomes of ALPPS
  in patients with cholangiocarcinoma. In this single-center study, a series of 30
  consecutive patients with cholangiocarcinoma (22 extrahepatic and 8 intrahepatic)
  who underwent ALPPS between 2011 and 2021 was evaluated. The ALPPS procedure ...
