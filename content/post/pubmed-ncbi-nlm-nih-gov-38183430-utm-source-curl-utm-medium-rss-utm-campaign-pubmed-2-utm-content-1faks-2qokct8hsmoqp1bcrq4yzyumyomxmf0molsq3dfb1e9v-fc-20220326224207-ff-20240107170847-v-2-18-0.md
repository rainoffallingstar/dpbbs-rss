description: Prognostic factors and standards of care for astrocytoma, isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant, CNS WHO grade 4, remain poorly defined. Here we sought
  to explore disease characteristics, prognostic markers, and outcome in patients
  with this newly defined tumor type. We determined molecular biomarkers and assembled
  clinical and outcome data in patients with IDH-mutant astrocytomas confirmed by
  central pathology review. Patients were identified in the German Glioma Network
  cohort ...
