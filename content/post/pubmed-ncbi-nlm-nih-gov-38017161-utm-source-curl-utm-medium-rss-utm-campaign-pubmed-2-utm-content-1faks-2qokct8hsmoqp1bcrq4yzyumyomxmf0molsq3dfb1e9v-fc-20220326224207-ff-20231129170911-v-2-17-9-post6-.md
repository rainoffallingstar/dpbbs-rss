description: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with lower cortical
  thickness (CT) in prefrontal, cingulate, and insular cortices in diverse trauma-affected
  samples. However, some studies have failed to detect differences between PTSD patients
  and healthy controls or reported that PTSD is associated with greater CT. Using
  data-driven dimensionality reduction, we sought to conduct a well-powered study
  to identify vulnerable networks without regard to neuroanatomic boundaries. Moreover,
