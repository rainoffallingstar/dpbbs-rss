description: Charge radii of neutron deficient ^{40}Sc and ^{41}Sc nuclei were determined
  using collinear laser spectroscopy. With the new data, the chain of Sc charge radii
  extends below the neutron magic number N=20 and shows a pronounced kink, generally
  taken as a signature of a shell closure, but one notably absent in the neighboring
  Ca, K, and Ar isotopic chains. Theoretical models that explain the trend at N=20
  for the Ca isotopes cannot reproduce this puzzling ...
