description: Rhabdomyosarcoma tumor cells resemble differentiating skeletal muscle
  cells, which unlike normal muscle cells, fail to undergo terminal differentiation,
  underlying their proliferative and metastatic properties. We identify the corepressor
  TLE3 as a key regulator of rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Wnt-pathway.
  Loss of TLE3 function leads to Wnt-pathway activation, reduced proliferation, decreased
  migration, and enhanced differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. ...
