description: In aging, the organism is unable to counteract certain harmful influences
  over its lifetime which leads to progressive dysfunction and eventually death, thus
  delineating aging as one failed process of adaptation to a set of aging stimuli.
  A central problem in understanding aging is hence to explain why the organism cannot
  adapt to these aging stimuli. The adaptation-maladaptation theory of aging proposes
  that in aging adaptation processes such as adaptive transcription, epigenetic ...
