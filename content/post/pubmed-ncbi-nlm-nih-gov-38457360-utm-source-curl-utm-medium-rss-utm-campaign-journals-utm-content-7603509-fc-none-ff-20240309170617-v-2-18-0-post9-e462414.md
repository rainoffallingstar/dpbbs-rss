description: Rituximab (RTX) and other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind directly
  to malignant cells are of great clinical value but are not effective for all patients.
  A major mechanism of action of RTX is antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)
  mediated by NK cells. Prior in vitro studies in our laboratory demonstrated that
  T cells contribute to maintaining the viability and cytotoxic potential of NK cells
  activated by anti-CD20-coated target B cells. Here, we conducted studies using a
