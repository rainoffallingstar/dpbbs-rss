description: 'CONCLUSION: The current study revealed that patients on dabigatran and
  rivaroxaban were prone to higher DOAC plasma levels upon hospital admission in comparison
  with apixaban and edoxaban. DOAC plasma level measurement in trauma patients might
  be warranted due to unpredictively low or high plasma concentrations. However, the
  clinical impact of altered plasma levels on both, bleeding and thromboembolic events,
  remains to be determined by future ...'
