description: Detecting unusual auditory stimuli is crucial for discovering potential
  threat. Locus coeruleus (LC), which coordinates attention, and amygdala, which is
  implicated in resource prioritization, both respond to deviant sounds. Evidence
  concerning their interaction, however, is sparse. Seeking to elucidate if human
  amygdala affects estimated LC activity during this process, we recorded pupillary
