description: Our understanding of how human skin cells differ according to anatomical
  site and tumour formation is limited. To address this, we have created a multiscale
  spatial atlas of healthy skin and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), incorporating in vivo
  optical coherence tomography, single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial global transcriptional
  profiling, and in situ sequencing. Computational spatial deconvolution and projection
  revealed the localisation of distinct cell populations to specific tissue ...
