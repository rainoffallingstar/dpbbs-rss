description: Cycling hypoxia (cycH) is a prevalent form of tumor hypoxia that is characterized
  by exposure of tumor cells to recurrent phases of hypoxia and reoxygenation. CycH
  has been associated with a particularly aggressive cellular phenotype of tumor cells
  and increased therapy resistance. By performing comparative analyses under normoxia,
  physoxia, chronic hypoxia, and cycH, we here uncover distinct effects of cycH on
  the phenotype of human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive cervical cancer cells. We ...
