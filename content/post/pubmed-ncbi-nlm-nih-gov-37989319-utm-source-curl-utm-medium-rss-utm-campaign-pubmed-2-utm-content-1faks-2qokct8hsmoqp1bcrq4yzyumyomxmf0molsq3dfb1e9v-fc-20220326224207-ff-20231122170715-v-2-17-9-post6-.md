description: RNA unwinding by DExH-type helicases underlies most RNA metabolism and
  function. It remains unresolved if and how the basic unwinding reaction of helicases
  is regulated by auxiliary domains. We explored the interplay between the RecA and
  auxiliary domains of the RNA helicase maleless (MLE) from Drosophila using structural
  and functional studies. We discovered that MLE exists in a dsRNA-bound open conformation
  and that the auxiliary dsRBD2 domain aligns the substrate RNA with the ...
