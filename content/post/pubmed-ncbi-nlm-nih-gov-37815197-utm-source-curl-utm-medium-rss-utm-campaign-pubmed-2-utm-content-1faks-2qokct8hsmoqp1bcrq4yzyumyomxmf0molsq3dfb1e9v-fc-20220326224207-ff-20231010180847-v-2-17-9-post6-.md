description: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), which relies on breathing-induced
  motion, requires realistic surrogate information of breathing variations to reconstruct
  the tumor trajectory and motion variability of normal tissues accurately. Therefore,
  the SimRT surface-guided respiratory monitoring system has been installed on a Siemens
  CT scanner. This work evaluated the temporal and spatial accuracy of SimRT versus
  our commonly used pressure sensor, AZ-733 V. A dynamic thorax phantom was ...
