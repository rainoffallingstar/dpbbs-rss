  population. Cell-based therapies, while having shown benefits for the treatment
  of chronic wounds, have not yet achieved widespread adoption into clinical practice.
  We developed a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to precisely edit murine dendritic cells to
  enhance their therapeutic potential for healing chronic wounds. Using single-cell
  RNA sequencing of tolerogenic dendritic cells, we identified N-myc downregulated
