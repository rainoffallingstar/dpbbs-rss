description: Nuclei contain essential information for cell states, including chromatin
  and RNA profiles - features which are nowadays accessible using high-throughput
  sequencing applications. Here, we describe analytical pipelines including nucleus
  isolation from differentiated xylem tissues by fluorescence-activated nucleus sorting
  (FANS), as well as subsequent SMART-seq2-based transcriptome profiling and assay
  for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC)-seq-based chromatin analysis. Combined
