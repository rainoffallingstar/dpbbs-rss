description: Anti-van't Hoff-Le Bel configured p-block element species possess intrinsically
  high reactivity and are thus challenging to isolate. Consequently, numerous elements
  in this configuration, including square-planar germanium(IV), remain unexplored.
  Herein, we follow a concept to reach anti-van't Hoff-Le Bel reactivity by ligand
  dissociation from a rigid calix[4]pyrrole germane in its bis(thf) adduct. While
  the macrocyclic ligand assures square-planar coordination in the uncomplexed form,
