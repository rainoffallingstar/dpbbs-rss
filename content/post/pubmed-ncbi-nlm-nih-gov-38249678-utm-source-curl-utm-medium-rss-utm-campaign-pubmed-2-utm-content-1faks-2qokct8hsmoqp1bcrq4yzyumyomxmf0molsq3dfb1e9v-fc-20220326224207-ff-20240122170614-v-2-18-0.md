description: Graphene-based materials (GBM) are promising cementitious composite additives
  that can significantly improve the mechanical characteristics and durability of
  concrete due to their unique properties, such as high surface area and aspect ratio
  and excellent tensile strength, to name a few. To display their full potential,
  GBM have to be homogeneously dispersed into the aqueous environment of cement-based
  matrices. The present study addresses the issue of limited dispersibility in the
  aqueous ...
