description: Rifampicin is a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein
  (P-gp/ABCB1), leading to profound drug-drug interactions. In contrast, the chemically
  related rifabutin does not show such pronounced induction properties in vivo. The
  aim of our study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the different induction
  potentials of rifampicin and rifabutin in primary human hepatocytes and to analyze
  the mechanism of potential differences. Therefore, we evaluated CYP3A4/ABCB1 ...
