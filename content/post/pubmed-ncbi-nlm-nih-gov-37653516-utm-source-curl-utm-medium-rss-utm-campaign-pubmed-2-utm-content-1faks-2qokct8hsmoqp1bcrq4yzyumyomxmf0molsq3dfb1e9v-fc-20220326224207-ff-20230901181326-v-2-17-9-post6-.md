description: Neuroimaging analyses of brain structure and function in autism have
  typically been conducted in isolation, missing the sensitivity gains of linking
  data across modalities. Here we focus on the integration of structural and functional
  organisational properties of brain regions. We aim to identify novel brain-organisation
  phenotypes of autism. We utilised multimodal MRI (T1-, diffusion-weighted and resting
  state functional), behavioural and clinical data from the EU AIMS Longitudinal ...
