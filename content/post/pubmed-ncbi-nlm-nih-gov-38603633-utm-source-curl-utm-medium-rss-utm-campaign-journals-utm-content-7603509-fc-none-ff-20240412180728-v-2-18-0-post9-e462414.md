description: Inflammatory responses must be tightly coordinated with the activation
  of emergency myelopoiesis to produce potent myeloid cells that fight infection without
  causing excessive host damage. Here, we show that GM-CSF programs myeloid committed
  progenitors to produce trained macrophages (increased cytokine response), but programs
  the upstream non-committed LKS+ progenitors to produce tolerized macrophages (decreased
  cytokine response). In myeloid progenitors, GM-CSF strongly activates STAT5, ...
