description: 'CONCLUSION: The supplemental application of an acellular collagen-elastin
  matrix showed beneficial effects in histological, radiological, and functional analysis.
  Therefore, applying a collagen-elastin matrix around the nerve after peripheral
  nerve injury or surgery may have beneficial effects on preventing scar tissue formation
  in the long run. This represents a feasible approach to avoid scar tissue formation
