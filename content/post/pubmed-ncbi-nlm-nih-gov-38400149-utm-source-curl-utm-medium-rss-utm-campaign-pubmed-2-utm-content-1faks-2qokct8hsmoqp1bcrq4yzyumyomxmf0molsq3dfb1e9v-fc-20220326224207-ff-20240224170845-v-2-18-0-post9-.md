description: Information on the dynamics and decline/persistence of antibody titres
  is important in vaccine development. A recent vaccine trial in malaria-exposed,
  healthy African adults and children living in a malaria hyperendemic and seasonal
  area (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso) was the first study in which BK-SE36/CpG was administered
  to different age groups. In 5- to 10-year-old children, the risk of malaria infection
  was markedly lower in the BK-SE36/CpG arm compared to the control arm. We report
