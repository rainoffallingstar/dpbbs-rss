description: Toxin-antitoxin systems (TAs) are abundant in bacterial chromosomes and
  can arrest growth under stress, but usually remain inactive. TAs have been increasingly
  implicated in halting the growth of infected bacteria from bacteriophages or foreign
  genetic elements^(1,2) to protect the population (abortive infection, Abi). The
  vast diversity and abundance of TAs and other Abi systems³ suggest they play an
  important immunity role, yet what allows them to sense attack remains largely enigmatic.
