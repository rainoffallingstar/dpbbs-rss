description: Organic matter in extraterrestrial samples is a complex material that
  might have played an important role in the delivery of prebiotic molecules to the
  early Earth. We report here on the identification of nitrogen-containing compounds
  such as amino acids and N-heterocycles within the recent observed meteorite fall
  Winchcombe by high-spatial resolution spectroscopy techniques. Although nitrogen
  contents of Winchcombe organic matter are low (N/C ~ 1-3%), we were able to detect
  the presence ...
