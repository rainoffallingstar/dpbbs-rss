description: High-throughput DNA sequencing studies increasingly associate DNA variants
  with congenital heart disease (CHD). However, functional modeling is a crucial prerequisite
  for translating genomic data into clinical care. We used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeting
  of 12 candidate genes in the vertebrate model medaka (Oryzias latipes), five of
  which showed a novel cardiovascular phenotype spectrum in F0 (crispants), mapre2,
  smg7, cdc42bpab, ankrd11, and myrf, which encodes a transcription factor ...
