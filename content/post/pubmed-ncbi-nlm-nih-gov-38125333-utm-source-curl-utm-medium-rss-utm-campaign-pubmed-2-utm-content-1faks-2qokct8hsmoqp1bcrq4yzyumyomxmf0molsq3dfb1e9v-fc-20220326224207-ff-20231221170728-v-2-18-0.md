description: Long-term outcome after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of
  acute type B aortic dissection (aTBAD) is still underreported in current literature.
  This case report shows persistence of aortic remodeling without secondary complication
  or need of reintervention 13 years after TEVAR. A 45-year-old woman was referred
  to the emergency room with aTBAD. Due to early diameter progression in combination
  with therapy-refractory pain and uncontrolled hypertension, TEVAR was performed.
