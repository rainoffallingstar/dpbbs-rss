description: We present the case of a woman in her 60s with Child-Pugh C cirrhosis
  who developed pericardial tamponade during an admission for a haemothorax secondary
  to a mechanical fall. The patient developed haemodynamic compromise with a rapid
  decline in renal function. During an open subxiphoid drain tube insertion, a pre-existing

  on view. The serum ascites albumin gradient was 14 g/L. Maximal medical therapy
