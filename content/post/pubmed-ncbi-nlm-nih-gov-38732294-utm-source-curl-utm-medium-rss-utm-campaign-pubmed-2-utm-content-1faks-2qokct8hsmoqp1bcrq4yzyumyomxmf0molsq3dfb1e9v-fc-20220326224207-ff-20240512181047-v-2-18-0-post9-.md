  prior to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may be feasible in conjunction
  with a spectral detector CT scanner. This prospective single-center study considered
  100 consecutive patients clinically referred for pre-TAVI CT. They were examined
  on a dual-layer detector CT scanner to obtain an ECG-gated cardiac scan and a non-ECG-gated
  aortoiliofemoral scan. Either a standard contrast media (SCM) protocol using ...
