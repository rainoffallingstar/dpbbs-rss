description: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly immunogenic skin cancer primarily
  induced by Merkel cell polyomavirus, which is driven by the expression of the oncogenic
  T antigens (T-Ags). Blockade of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) pathway
  has shown remarkable response rates, but evidence for therapy-associated T-Ag-specific
  immune response and therapeutic strategies for the nonresponding fraction are both
  limited. We tracked T-Ag-reactive CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood of 26 MCC ...
