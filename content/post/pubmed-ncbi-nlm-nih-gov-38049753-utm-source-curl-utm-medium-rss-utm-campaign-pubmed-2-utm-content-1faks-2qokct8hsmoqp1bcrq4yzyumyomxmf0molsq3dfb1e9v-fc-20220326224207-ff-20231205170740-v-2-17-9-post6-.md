description: 'CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the network typology developed
  in the context of diabetes patients is relevant and mostly replicable in networks
  of multi-morbid older adults. We found that a care network typology based on mechanisms
  offered additional information beyond network composition. It also appears that
  the network type can change over time, but more research is needed to confirm this.
  This study suggests that interventions in avoidant or struggling networks are difficult.
