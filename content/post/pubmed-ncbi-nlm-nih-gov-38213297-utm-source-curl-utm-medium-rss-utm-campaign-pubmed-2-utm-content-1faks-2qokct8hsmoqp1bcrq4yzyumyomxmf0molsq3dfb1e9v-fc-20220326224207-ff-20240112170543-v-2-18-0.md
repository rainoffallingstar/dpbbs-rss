description: In this issue of Cancer Discovery, Suehnholz and colleagues describe
  their efforts to quantify the gradual yet steady progress of precision oncology
  by surveying the regulatory approvals of targeted cancer therapies, and thus the
  actionability of corresponding molecular alterations in clinical practice, over
  more than 20 years. Their work also suggests a relationship between the discovery
  of candidate therapeutic targets through comprehensive tumor profiling and molecularly
  guided cancer ...
