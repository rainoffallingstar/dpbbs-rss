description: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is a pattern
  recognition receptor and plays a critical role in the immune response. TREM-1 activation
  leads to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, as
  well as its own expression and circulating levels of the cleaved soluble extracellular
  portion of TREM-1 (sTREM-1). Because patients with sepsis and septic shock show
  elevated sTREM-1 levels, TREM-1 has attracted attention as an important contributor
  to ...
