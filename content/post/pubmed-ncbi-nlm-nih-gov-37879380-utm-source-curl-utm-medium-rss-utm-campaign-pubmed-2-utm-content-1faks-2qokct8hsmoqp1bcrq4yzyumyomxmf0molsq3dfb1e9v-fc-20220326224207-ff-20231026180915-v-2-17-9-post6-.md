description: In Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been found
  to be enriched in the synovial fluid. Despite their accumulation, they are unable
  to suppress synovial inflammation. Recently, we showed the synovial enrichment of
  interleukin-9 (IL-9) producing helper T cells and its positive correlation with
  disease activity. Therefore, we investigated the impact of IL-9 on synovial Tregs
  in RA. Here, we confirmed high synovial Tregs in RA patients, however these cells
