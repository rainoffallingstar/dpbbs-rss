description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly indicate the presence of complement
  proteins on PNPs surface but partially derived from an unspecific deposition rather
  than an effective complement activation. The presence of a targeting antibody favors
  the activation of the classical pathway, but its absence allows an increased activation
  of the alternative pathway. This results in similar opsonization of both PNPs and
  similar phagocytosis by macrophages, without an impairment of the activity of ...'
