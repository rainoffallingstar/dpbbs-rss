description: Understanding the role of parton mass and Casimir color factors in the
  quantum chromodynamics parton shower represents an important step in characterizing
  the emission properties of heavy quarks. Recent experimental advances in jet substructure
  techniques have provided the opportunity to isolate and characterize gluon emissions
