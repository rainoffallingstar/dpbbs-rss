  interdisciplinary patient care, as well as preclinical experimental models. This
  study evaluates neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte
  ratio (PLR) in psoriasis patients and five murine models of psoriasis-like skin

  different promotors. We performed a single-center prospective observational study
