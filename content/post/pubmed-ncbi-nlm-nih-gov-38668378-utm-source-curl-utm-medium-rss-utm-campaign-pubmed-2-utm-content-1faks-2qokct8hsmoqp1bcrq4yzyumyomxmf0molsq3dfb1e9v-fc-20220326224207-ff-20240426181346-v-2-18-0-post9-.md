description: Over the past decade, there have been reports of short novel functional
  peptides (less than 100 aa in length) translated from so-called non-coding RNAs
  (ncRNAs) that have been characterized using mass spectrometry (MS) and large-scale
  proteomics studies. Therefore, understanding the bivalent functions of some ncRNAs
  as transcripts that encode both functional RNAs and short peptides, which we named
  ncPEPs, will deepen our understanding of biology and disease. In 2020, we published
