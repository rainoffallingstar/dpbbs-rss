description: We recently derived and validated a serum-based microRNA risk score (miR-score)
  that predicted colorectal cancer (CRC) occurrence with very high accuracy within
  14 years of follow-up in a population-based cohort study from Germany (ESTHER cohort).
  Here, we aimed to evaluate associations of the CRC-specific miR-score with the risk
  of developing other common cancers, including female breast cancer (BC), lung cancer
  (LC), and prostate cancer (PC), in the ESTHER cohort. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) ...
