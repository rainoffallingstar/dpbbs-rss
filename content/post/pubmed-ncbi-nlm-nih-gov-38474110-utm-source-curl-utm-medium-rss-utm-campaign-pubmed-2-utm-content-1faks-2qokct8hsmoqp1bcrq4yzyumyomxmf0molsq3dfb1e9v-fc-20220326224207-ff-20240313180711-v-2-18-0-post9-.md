description: This study aims to characterize the proteome composition of organ-derived
  protein extracts from rabbits. Protein isolation was performed using soft homogenization
  and size exclusion via ultrafiltration. The proteome analysis of the ultrafiltrates
  was conducted using gel electrophoresis, and the mass spectrometry data were subjected
  to gene ontology analysis. Proteomic profiling revealed comprehensive protein profiles
  associated with RNA regulation, fatty acid binding, inflammatory ...
