description: Short Linear Motifs (SLiMs) are the smallest structural and functional
  components of modular eukaryotic proteins. They are also the most abundant, especially
  when considering post-translational modifications. As well as being found throughout
  the cell as part of regulatory processes, SLiMs are extensively mimicked by intracellular
