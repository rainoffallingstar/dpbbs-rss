description: Bacterial protoplasts are known to reproduce independently of canonical
  molecular biological processes. Although their reproduction is thought to be influenced
  by environmental conditions, the growth of protoplasts in their natural habitat
  has never been empirically studied. Here, we studied the life cycle of protoplasts
  in their native environment. Contrary to the previous perception that protoplasts
  reproduce in an erratic manner, cells in our study reproduced in a defined sequence
