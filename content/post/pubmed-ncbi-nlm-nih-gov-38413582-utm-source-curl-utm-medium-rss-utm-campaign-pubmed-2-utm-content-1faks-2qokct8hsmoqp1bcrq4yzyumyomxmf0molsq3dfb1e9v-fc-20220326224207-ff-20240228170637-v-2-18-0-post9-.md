description: SNURPORTIN-1, encoded by SNUPN, plays a central role in the nuclear import
  of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. However, its physiological function
  remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate 18 children from 15 unrelated
  families who present with atypical muscular dystrophy and neurological defects.
  Nine hypomorphic SNUPN biallelic variants, predominantly clustered in the last coding
  exon, are ascertained to segregate with the disease. We demonstrate that mutant
