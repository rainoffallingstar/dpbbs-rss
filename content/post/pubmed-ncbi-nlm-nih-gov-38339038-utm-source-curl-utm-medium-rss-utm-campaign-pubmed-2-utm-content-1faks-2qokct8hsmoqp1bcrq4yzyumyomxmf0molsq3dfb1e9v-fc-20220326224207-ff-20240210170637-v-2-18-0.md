description: Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with various deficits in sensing
  and responding to reductions in oxygen availability (hypoxia). Here we summarize
  the evidence pointing to a central role of hypoxia in PD, discuss the relation of
  hypoxia and oxygen dependence with pathological hallmarks of PD, including mitochondrial
  dysfunction, dopaminergic vulnerability, and alpha-synuclein-related pathology,
  and highlight the link with cellular and systemic oxygen sensing. We describe cases
