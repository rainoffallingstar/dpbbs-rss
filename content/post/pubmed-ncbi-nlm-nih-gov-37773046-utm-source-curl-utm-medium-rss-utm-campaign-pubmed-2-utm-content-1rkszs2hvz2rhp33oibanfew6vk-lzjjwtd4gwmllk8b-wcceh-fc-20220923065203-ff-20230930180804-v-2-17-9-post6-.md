description: Targeted eradication of transformed or otherwise dysregulated cells using
  monoclonal antibodies (mAb), antibody-drug conjugates (ADC), T cell engagers (TCE),
  or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) cells is very effective for hematologic diseases.
  Unlike the breakthrough progress achieved for B cell malignancies, there is a pressing
  need to find suitable antigens for myeloid malignancies. CD123, the interleukin-3
  (IL-3) receptor alpha-chain, is highly expressed in various hematological ...
