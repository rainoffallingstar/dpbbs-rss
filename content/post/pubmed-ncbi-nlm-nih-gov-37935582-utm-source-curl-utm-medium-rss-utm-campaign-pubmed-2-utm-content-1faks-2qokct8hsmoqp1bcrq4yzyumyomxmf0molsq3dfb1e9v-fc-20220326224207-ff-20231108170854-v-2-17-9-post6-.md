description: Leishmaniasis is a detrimental disease causing serious changes in quality
  of life and some forms can lead to death. The disease is spread by the parasite
  Leishmania transmitted by sandfly vectors and their primary hosts are vertebrates
  including humans. The pathogen penetrates host cells and secretes proteins (the
  secretome) to repurpose cells for pathogen growth and to alter cell signaling via
  host-pathogen protein-protein interactions). Here, we present LeishMANIAdb, a database
