description: In mice, exit from the totipotent two-cell (2C) stage embryo requires
  silencing of the 2C-associated transcriptional program. However, the molecular mechanisms
  involved in this process remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the
  2C-specific transcription factor double homeobox protein (DUX) mediates an essential
  negative feedback loop by inducing the expression of DUXBL to promote this silencing.
  We show that DUXBL gains accessibility to DUX-bound regions specifically upon ...
