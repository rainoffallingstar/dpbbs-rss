description: We previously demonstrated that a reduced-intensity chemotherapy schedule
  can safely replace Hyper-CVAD cycle 1 when combined with imatinib in adults with
  Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In the present randomized
  GRAAPH-2014 trial, we used nilotinib and addressed the omission of cytarabine (Ara-C)
  in consolidation. The primary objective was the major molecular response (MMR) rate
  measured by BCR::ABL1 quantification after cycle 4 (end of consolidation). ...
