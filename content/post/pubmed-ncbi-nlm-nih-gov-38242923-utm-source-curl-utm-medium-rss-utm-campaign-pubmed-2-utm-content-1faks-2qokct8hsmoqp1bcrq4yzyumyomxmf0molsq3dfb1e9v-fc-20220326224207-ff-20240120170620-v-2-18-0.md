description: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters brain network connectivity. Structural
  covariance networks (SCNs) reflect morphological covariation between brain regions.
  SCNs may elucidate how altered brain network topology in TBI influences long-term
  outcomes. Here, we assessed whether SCN organisation is altered in individuals with
  chronic moderate-severe TBI (≥ 10 years post-injury) and associations with cognitive
  performance. This case-control study included fifty individuals with ...
