description: 'CONCLUSION: In the context of LR, our results showed a correlation of
  preoperatively determined IL-6 with the extent of LF present. Higher serum baseline
  IL-6 concentrations were associated with a higher degree of LF, whereas no other
  blood parameter or score was that predictive for LF. Our results suggest that baseline
  IL-6 might serve as a valuable parameter to assess LF prior to LR. More patients
  need to be analyzed to further evaluate and confirm the predictive accuracy of IL-6
