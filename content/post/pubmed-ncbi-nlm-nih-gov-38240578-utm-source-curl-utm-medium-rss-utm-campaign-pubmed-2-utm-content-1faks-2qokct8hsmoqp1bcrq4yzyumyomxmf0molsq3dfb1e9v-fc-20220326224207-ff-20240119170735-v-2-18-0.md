  fragmented genomes. Here, comprehensive gut virome detection procedure is developed
  involving virus-like particle (VLP) enrichment from ≈500 g feces and combined sequencing

  is assembled consisting of 21,499 non-redundant viral operational taxonomic units
  (vOTUs) that are significantly longer than those obtained by short-read sequencing
