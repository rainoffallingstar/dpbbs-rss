description: CAR-T cells hold promise as a therapy for B-cell-derived malignancies,
  yet despite their impressive initial response rates, a significant proportion of
  patients ultimately experience relapse. While recent studies have explored the mechanisms
  of in vivo CAR-T cell function, little is understood about the activation of surrounding
  CARneg bystander T-cells and their potential to enhance tumor responses. We performed
  single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on non-human primate (NHP) and ...
