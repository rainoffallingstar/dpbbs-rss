description: While pathological tissue analysis is typically performed on single 2-dimensional
  (2D) histological reference slides, 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a sequence
  of histological sections could provide novel opportunities for spatial analysis
  of the extracted tissue. In this review, we analyze recent works published after
  2018 and report information on the extracted tissue types, the section thickness
  and the number of sections used for reconstruction. By analyzing the ...
