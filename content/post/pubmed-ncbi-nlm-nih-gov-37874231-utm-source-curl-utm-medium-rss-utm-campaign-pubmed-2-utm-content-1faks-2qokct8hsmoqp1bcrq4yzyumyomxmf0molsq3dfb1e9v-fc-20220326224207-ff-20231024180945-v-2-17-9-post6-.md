description: We present the design and characterization of a cryogenic window based
  on an ultra-thin aluminized biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate foil at
  T < 10 K, which can withstand a pressure difference larger than 1 bar at a leak
  rate <1×10-9 mbar l/s. Its thickness of ∼1.7 μm makes it transparent to various
  types of particles over a broad energy range. To optimize the transfer of 100 keV
  antiprotons through the window, we tested the degrading properties of different
  aluminum coated ...
