description: Macroautophagy/autophagy is a highly-conserved catabolic process eliminating
  dysfunctional cellular components and invading pathogens. Autophagy malfunction
  contributes to disorders such as cancer, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases.
  Understanding autophagy regulation in health and disease has been the focus of the
  last decades. We previously provided an integrated database for autophagy research,
  the Autophagy Regulatory Network (ARN). For the last seven years, this resource
