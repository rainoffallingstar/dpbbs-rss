description: On the basis of revisions of some of the systematic errors, we reanalyzed
  the electron-antineutrino angular correlation (a coefficient) in free neutron decay
  inferred from the recoil energy spectrum of the protons which are detected in 4π
  by the aSPECT spectrometer. With a=-0.104 02(82) the new value differs only marginally
  from the one published in 2020. The experiment also has sensitivity to b, the Fierz
  interference term. From a correlated (b,a) fit to the proton recoil spectrum, we
  derive ...
