description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells are a complex and
  heterogeneous gene therapy product with variable phenotype compositions. A higher
  proportion of less differentiated CAR T cells is usually associated with improved
  antitumoral function and persistence. We describe in this study a novel receptor-targeted
  lentiviral vector (LV) named 62L-LV that preferentially transduces less differentiated
  T cells marked by the L-selectin receptor CD62L, with transduction rates of up to
  70% ...
