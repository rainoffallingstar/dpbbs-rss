description: Testing to detect mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and high-grade microsatellite
  instability (MSI-H) has become an integral part of the routine diagnostic workup
  for colorectal cancer (CRC). While MSI was initially considered to be a possible
  indicator of a hereditary disposition to cancer (Lynch syndrome, LS), today the
  prediction of the therapy response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is in the
  foreground. Corresponding recommendations and testing algorithms are available for
