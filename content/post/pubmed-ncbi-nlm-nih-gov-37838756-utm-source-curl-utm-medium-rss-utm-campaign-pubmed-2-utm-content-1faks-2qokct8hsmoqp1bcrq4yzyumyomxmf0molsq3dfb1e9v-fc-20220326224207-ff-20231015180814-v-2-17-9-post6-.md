description: Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a rare disease caused by the generalized
  deposition of misfolded free light chains. Patients with immunoglobulin M gammopathy
  (IgM) and indolent B-cell lymphoma such as marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) may in some
  instances develop AL amyloidosis. So far, CAR T cells for AL amyloidosis have only
  been reported utilizing the B cell maturation antigen as target, while CD19 has
  so far not been used in AL amyloidosis.We report the case of a 71-year-old male,
