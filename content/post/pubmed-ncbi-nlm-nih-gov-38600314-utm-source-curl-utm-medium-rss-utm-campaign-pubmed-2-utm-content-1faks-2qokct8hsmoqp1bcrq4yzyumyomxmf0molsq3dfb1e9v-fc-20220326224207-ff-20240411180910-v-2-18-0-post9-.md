description: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) constitutes a rare
  and aggressive malignancy originating from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with
  a primarily cutaneous tropism followed by dissemination to the bone marrow and other
  organs. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of the tumor methylome in an extended
  cohort of 45 BPDCN patients supplemented by WES and RNA-seq as well as ATAC-seq
  on selected cases. We determined the BPDCN DNA methylation profile and observed
  a dramatic ...
