description: The Bunyavirales order is a large and diverse group of segmented negative-strand
  RNA viruses. Several virus families within this order contain important human pathogens,
  including Sin Nombre virus (SNV) of the Hantaviridae. Despite the high epidemic
  potential of bunyaviruses, specific medical countermeasures such as vaccines or
  antivirals are missing. The multifunctional ~250 kDa L protein of hantaviruses,
  amongst other functional domains, harbors the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
  and ...
