description: The phase 2 CLL2-BAAG trial tested the measurable residual disease (MRD)-guided
  triple combination of acalabrutinib, venetoclax and obinutuzumab after an optional
  bendamustine debulking in 45 patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (one patient
  was excluded from the analysis due to a violation of exclusion criteria). MRD was
  measured by flow cytometry (FCM, undetectable MRD <10-4) in peripheral blood (PB)
  and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) ...
