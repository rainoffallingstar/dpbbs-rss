description: Rupture or dissection of thoracic aortic aneurysms is still the leading
  cause of death for patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. Inflammation and matrix
  digestion regulated by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) play a major role in the pathological
  remodeling of the aortic media. Regnase-1 is an endoribonuclease shown to cleave
  the mRNA of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6. Considering the major
  anti-inflammatory effects of regnase-1, here, we aimed to determine ...
