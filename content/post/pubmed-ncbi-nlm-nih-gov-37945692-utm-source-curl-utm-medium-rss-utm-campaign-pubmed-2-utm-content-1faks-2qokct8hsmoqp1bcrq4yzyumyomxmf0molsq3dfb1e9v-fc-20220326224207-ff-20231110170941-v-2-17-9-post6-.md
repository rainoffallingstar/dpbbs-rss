description: Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is an aggressive hematopoietic
  disorder of infancy and early childhood driven by constitutively active RAS signaling
  and characterized by abnormal proliferation of the granulocytic-monocytic blood
  cell lineage. Most JMML patients require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  for cure, but the risk of relapse is high for some JMML subtypes. Azacitidine was
