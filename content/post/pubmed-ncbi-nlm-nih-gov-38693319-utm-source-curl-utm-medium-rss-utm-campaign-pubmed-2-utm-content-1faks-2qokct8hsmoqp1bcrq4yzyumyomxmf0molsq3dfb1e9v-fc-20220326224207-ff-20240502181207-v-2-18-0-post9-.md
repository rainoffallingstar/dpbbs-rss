description: Reduced processing speed is a core deficit in major depressive disorder
  (MDD) and has been linked to altered structural brain network connectivity. Ample
  evidence highlights the involvement of genetic-immunological processes in MDD and
  specific depressive symptoms. Here, we extended these findings by examining associations
  between polygenic scores for tumor necrosis factor-α blood levels (TNF-α PGS), structural
  brain connectivity, and processing speed in a large sample of MDD ...
