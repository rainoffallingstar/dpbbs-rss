description: The 2015-17 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas subsided faster
  than expected and evolving population immunity was postulated to be the main reason.
  Herd immunization is suggested to occur around 60-70% seroprevalence, depending
  on demographic density and climate suitability. However, herd immunity was only
  documented for a few cities in South America, meaning a substantial portion of the
  population might still be vulnerable to a future Zika virus outbreak. The aim of
  our study was ...
