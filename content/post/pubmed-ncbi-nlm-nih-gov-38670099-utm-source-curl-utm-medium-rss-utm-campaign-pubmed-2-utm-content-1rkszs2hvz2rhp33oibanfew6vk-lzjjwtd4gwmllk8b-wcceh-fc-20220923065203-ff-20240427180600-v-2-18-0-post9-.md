  rates and limited treatments. While immunotherapies have shown some efficacy, the
  immunological consequences of administering immune-activating agents to CTCL patients
  have not been systematically characterized. We apply a suite of high-dimensional
  technologies to investigate the local, cellular, and systemic responses in CTCL
  patients receiving either mono- or combination anti-PD-1 plus interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)
