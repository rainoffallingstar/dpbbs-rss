description: Dysregulated B cell responses have been described in inflammatory-bowel
  disease (IBD) patients; however, the role of B cells in IBD pathology remained incompletely
  understood. We here provide evidence for a detrimental role of activated B cells
  during the onset of autoimmune intestinal inflammation. Using Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome
  interacting protein deficient (Wipf1^(-/-)) mice as a mouse model of chronic colitis,
  we identified CD86 expression on activated B cells as a crucial ...
