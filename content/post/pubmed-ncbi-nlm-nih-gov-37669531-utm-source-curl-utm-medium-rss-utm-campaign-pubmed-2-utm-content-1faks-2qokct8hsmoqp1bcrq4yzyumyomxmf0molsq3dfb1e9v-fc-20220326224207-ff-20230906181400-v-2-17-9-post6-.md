description: Fusion of biological membranes is fundamental in various physiological
  events. The fusion process involves several intermediate stages with energy barriers
  that are tightly dependent on the mechanical and physical properties of the system,
  one of which is membrane tension. As previously established, the late stages of
  fusion, including hemifusion diaphragm and pore expansions, are favored by membrane
  tension. However, a current understanding of how the energy barrier of earlier fusion
