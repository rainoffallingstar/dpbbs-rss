description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy for which allogeneic
  stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) often remains the only curative therapeutic
  approach. However, incapability of T cells to recognize and eliminate residual leukemia
  stem cells (LSCs) might lead to an insufficient graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect
  and relapse. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on bone marrow (BM) T
