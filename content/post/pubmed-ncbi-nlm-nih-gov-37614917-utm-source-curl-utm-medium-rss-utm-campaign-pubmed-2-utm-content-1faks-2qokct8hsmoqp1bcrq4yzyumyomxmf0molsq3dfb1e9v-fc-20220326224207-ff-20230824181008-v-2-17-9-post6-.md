  of epigenetics to phenotypic plasticity, because confounding effects of genetic
  variation are negligible. In the last decade, the apomictic parthenogenetic marbled
  crayfish, Procambarus virginalis, has been developed as a model to investigate the

  in detail. This crayfish originated about 30 years ago by autotriploidy from a single
