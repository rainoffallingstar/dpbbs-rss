description: Stem cells exhibit prominent clusters controlling the transcription of
  genes into RNA. These clusters form by a phase-separation mechanism, and their size
  and shape are controlled via an amphiphilic effect of transcribed genes. Here, we
  construct amphiphile-nanomotifs purely from DNA, and we achieve similar size and
  shape control for phase-separated droplets formed from fully synthetic, self-interacting
  DNA-nanomotifs. Increasing amphiphile concentrations induce rounding of droplets,
