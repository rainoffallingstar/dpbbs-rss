description: Protection of the coronary arteries during donor heart maintenance is
  pivotal to improve results and prevent the development of coronary allograft vasculopathy.
  The effect of hypothermic, oxygenated perfusion (HOP) with the traditional HTK and
  the novel HTK-N solution on the coronary microvasculature of donation-after-circulatory-death
  (DCD) hearts is known. However, the effect on the coronary macrovasculature is unknown.
  Thus, we maintained porcine DCD hearts by HOP with HTK or HTK-N for 4 ...
