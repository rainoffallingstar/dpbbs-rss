description: Several bacterial toxins and viruses can deform membranes through multivalent
  binding to lipids for clathrin-independent endocytosis. However, it remains unclear,
  how membrane deformation and endocytic internalization are mechanistically linked.
  Here we show that many lipid-binding virions induce membrane deformation and clathrin-independent
  endocytosis, suggesting a common mechanism based on multivalent lipid binding by
  globular particles. We create a synthetic cellular system consisting of ...
