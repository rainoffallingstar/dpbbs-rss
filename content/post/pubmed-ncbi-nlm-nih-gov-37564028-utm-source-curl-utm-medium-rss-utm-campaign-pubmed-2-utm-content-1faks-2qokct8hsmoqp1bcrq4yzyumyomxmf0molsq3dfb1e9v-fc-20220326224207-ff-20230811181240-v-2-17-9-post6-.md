description: Astrocytes are intricately involved in the activity of neural circuits;
  however, their basic physiology of interacting with nearby neurons is not well established.
  Using two-photon imaging of neurons and astrocytes during higher frequency stimulation
  of hippocampal CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral (Scc) excitatory synapses, we could show
  that increasing levels of released glutamate accelerated local astrocytic Ca^(2+)
  elevation. However, blockage of glutamate transporters did not abolish ...
