description: 'The 0106-B1-bioactive glass (BG) composition (in wt %: 37.5 SiO(2),
  22.6 CaO, 5.9 Na(2)O, 4.0 P(2)O(5), 12.0 K(2)O, 5.5 MgO, and 12.5 B(2)O(3)) has
  demonstrated favorable processing properties and promising bone regeneration potential.
  The present study aimed to evaluate the biological effects of the incorporation
  of highly pro-angiogenic copper (Cu) in 0106-B1-BG in vitro using human bone marrow-derived
  mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) as well as its in vivo potential for bone ...'
