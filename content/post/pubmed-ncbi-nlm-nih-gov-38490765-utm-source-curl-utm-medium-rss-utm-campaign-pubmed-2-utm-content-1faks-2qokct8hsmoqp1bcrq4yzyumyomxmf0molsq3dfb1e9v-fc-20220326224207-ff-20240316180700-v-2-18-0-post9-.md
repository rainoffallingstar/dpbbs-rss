description: Myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition have been recognized increasingly
  over the past decade with numerous newly described disorders. Penetrance, age of
  onset, phenotypic heterogeneity, and somatic driver events differ widely among these
  conditions and sometimes even within family members with the same variant, making
  risk assessment and counseling of these individuals inherently difficult. In this
  review, we will shed light on high malignant penetrance (e.g., CEBPA, ...
