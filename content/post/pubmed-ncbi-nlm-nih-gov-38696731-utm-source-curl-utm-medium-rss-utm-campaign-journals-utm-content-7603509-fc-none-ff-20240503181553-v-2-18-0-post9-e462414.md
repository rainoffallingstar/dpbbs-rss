description: This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen
  receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and bispecific antibodies for relapsed/refractory
  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R DLBCL). We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane
  databases until July 2023 for trials assessing CAR T-cell therapies and CD20×CD3
  bispecific antibodies as third- or subsequent-line in R/R DLBCL. Random effects
  models estimated the complete response (CR) rate and secondary outcomes, with ...
