description: Cytoskeletal dynamics are essential for cellular homeostasis and development
  for both metazoans and protozoans. The function of cytoskeletal elements in protozoans
  can diverge from that of metazoan cells, with microtubules being more stable and
  actin filaments being more dynamic. This is particularly striking in protozoan parasites
  that evolved to enter metazoan cells. Here, we review recent progress towards understanding
