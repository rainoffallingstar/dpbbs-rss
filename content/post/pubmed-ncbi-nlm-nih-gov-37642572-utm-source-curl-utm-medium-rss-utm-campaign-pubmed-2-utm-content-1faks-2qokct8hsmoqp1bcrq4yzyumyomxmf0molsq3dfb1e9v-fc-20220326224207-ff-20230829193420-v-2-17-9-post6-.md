description: Background Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) can be divided into proliferative
  and nonproliferative types, which may have implications for outcomes after conventional
  transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE). Biopsy to identify proliferative HCC is
  not routinely performed before cTACE. Purpose To develop and validate a predictive
  model for identifying proliferative HCCs using CT imaging features and to compare
  therapeutic outcomes between predicted proliferative and nonproliferative HCCs ...
