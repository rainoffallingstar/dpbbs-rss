description: Disordered erythropoiesis is a feature of many hematologic diseases including
  sickle cell disease (SCD). However, very little is known about erythropoiesis in
  SCD. Here we show that while bone marrow (BM) erythroid progenitors and erythroblasts
  in thalassemia mice Hbbth3/+were increased more than 2 fold, they were expanded
  by only ~40% in Townes sickle mice (SS). We further show that the colony forming
  ability of SS erythroid progenitors was decreased and EPO/EPOR signaling was impaired
  in ...
