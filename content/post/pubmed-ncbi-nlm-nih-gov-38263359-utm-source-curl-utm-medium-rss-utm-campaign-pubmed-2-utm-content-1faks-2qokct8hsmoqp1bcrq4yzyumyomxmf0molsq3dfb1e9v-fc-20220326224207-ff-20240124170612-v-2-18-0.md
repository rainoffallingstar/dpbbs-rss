description: In higher plants, sexual reproduction is characterized by meiosis of
  the first cells of the germlines, and double fertilization of egg and central cell
  after gametogenesis. In contrast, in apomicts of the genus Boechera, meiosis is
  omitted or altered and only the central cell requires fertilization, while the embryo
  forms parthenogenetically from the egg cell. To deepen the understanding of the
  transcriptional basis underlying these differences, we applied RNA-Seq to compare
