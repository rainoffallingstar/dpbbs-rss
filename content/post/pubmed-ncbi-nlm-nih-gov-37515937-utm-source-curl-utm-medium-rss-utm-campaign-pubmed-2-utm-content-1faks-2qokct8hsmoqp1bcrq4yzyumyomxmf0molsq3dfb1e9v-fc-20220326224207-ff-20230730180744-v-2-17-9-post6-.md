description: 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is a biproduct of the Krebs cycle, which exists
  in a D- and L- enantiomer and is structurally similar to α-ketoglutarate. Both 2HG
  enantiomers have been described to accumulate in diverse cancer and immune cells
  and can influence cell fate and function. While D-2HG was originally considered
  as an 'oncometabolite' that aberrantly builds up in certain cancers, it is becoming
  clear that it also physiologically accumulates in immune cells and regulates immune
