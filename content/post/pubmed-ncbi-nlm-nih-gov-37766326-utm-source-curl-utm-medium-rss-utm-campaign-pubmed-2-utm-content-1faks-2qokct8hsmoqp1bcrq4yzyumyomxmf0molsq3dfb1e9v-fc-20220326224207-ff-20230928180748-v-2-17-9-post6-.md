description: With the end of the pandemic, COVID-19 has entered an endemic phase with
  expected seasonal spikes. Consequently, the implementation of easily accessible
  prognostic biomarkers for patients with COVID-19 remains an important area of research.
  In this monocentric study at a German tertiary care hospital, we determined the
  prognostic performance of different clinical and blood-based parameters in 412 COVID-19
  patients. We evaluated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), ...
