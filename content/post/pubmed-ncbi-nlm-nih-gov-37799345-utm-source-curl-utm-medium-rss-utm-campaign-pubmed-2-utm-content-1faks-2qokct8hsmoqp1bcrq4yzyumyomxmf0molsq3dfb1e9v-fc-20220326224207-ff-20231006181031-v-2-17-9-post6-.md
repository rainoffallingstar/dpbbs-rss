description: Recent evidence revealed important interactions between clonal hematopoiesis
  (CH) and cellular therapies established for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.
  The impact of CH on safety, efficacy, and outcome of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
  T-cell therapy is currently under investigation. We analyzed 110 patients with relapsed/refractory
  B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 105) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n =
  5), treated with Axicabtagene-Ciloleucel (39%), Tisagenlecleucel ...
