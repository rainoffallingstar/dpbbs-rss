description: Augmented reality (AR) apps, in which the virtual and real world are
  combined, can recreate instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and are therefore
  promising to measure cognition needed for IADL in early Alzheimer's disease (AD)
  both in the clinic and in the home settings. The primary aim of this study was to
  distinguish and classify healthy controls (HC) from participants with AD pathology
  in an early AD stage using an AR app. The secondary aims were to test the association
