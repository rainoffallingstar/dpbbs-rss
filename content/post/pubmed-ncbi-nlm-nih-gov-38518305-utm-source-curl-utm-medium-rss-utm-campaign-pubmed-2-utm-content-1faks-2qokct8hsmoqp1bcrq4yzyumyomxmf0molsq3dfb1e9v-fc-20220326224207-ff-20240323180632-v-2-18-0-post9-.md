description: We investigate the effect of resonant spin conversion of the neutrinos
  induced by the geometrical phase in a twisting magnetic field. We find that the
  geometrical phase originating from the rotation of the transverse magnetic field
  along the neutrino trajectory can trigger a resonant spin conversion of Dirac neutrinos
  inside the supernova, even if there were no such transitions in the fixed-direction
  field case. We have shown that, even though resonant spin conversion is too weak
  to affect ...
