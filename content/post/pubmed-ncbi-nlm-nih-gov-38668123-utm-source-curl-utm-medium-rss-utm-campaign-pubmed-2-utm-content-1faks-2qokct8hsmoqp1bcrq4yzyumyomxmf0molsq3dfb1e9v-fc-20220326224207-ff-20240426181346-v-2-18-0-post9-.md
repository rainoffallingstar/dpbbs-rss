description: Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting are widely used
  to study endothelial cells, for which the generation of viable single-cell suspensions
  is an essential first step. Two enzymatic approaches, collagenase A and dispase,
  are widely employed for endothelial cell isolation. In this study, the utility of
  both enzymatic approaches, alone and in combination, for endothelial cell isolation
  from juvenile and adult mouse lungs was assessed, considering the number, viability,
