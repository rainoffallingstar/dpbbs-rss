description: Plasma cells (PC) are highly specialized cells representing the end stage
  of B cell differentiation. We have shown that PC differentiation can be reproduced
  in vitro using elaborate culture systems. The molecular changes occurring during
  PC differentiation are recapitulated in this in vitro differentiation model. However,
  a major challenge exists to decipher the spatiotemporal epigenetic and transcriptional
  programs that drives the early stages of PC differentiation. We combined single
