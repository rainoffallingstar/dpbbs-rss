description: Epithelioid sarcoma (EpS) is an ultra-rare malignant soft-tissue cancer
  mostly affecting adolescents and young adults. EpS often exhibits an unfavorable
  clinical course with fatal outcome in ~50% of cases despite aggressive multimodal
  therapies combining surgery, chemotherapy, and irradiation. EpS is traditionally
  classified in a more common, less aggressive distal (classic) type, and a rarer
  aggressive proximal type. Both subtypes are characterized by a loss of nuclear INI1
  expression, ...
