description: In low-risk Myelodysplastic Neoplasms (MDS), increased activity of apoptosis-promoting
  factors such as tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and pro-apoptotic Fas ligand (CD95L)
  have been described as possible pathomechanisms leading to impaired erythropoiesis.
  Asunercept (APG101) is a novel therapeutic fusion protein blocking CD95, which has
  previously shown partial efficacy in reducing transfusion requirement in a clinical
  phase I trial for low-risk MDS patients (NCT01736436; 2012-11-26). In ...
