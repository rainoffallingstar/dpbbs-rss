description: Energetic stress compels cells to evolve adaptive mechanisms to adjust
  their metabolism. Inhibition of mTOR kinase complex 1 (mTORC1) is essential for
  cell survival during glucose starvation. How mTORC1 controls cell viability during
  glucose starvation is not well understood. Here we show that the mTORC1 effectors
  eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins 1/2 (4EBP1/2) confer protection
  to mammalian cells and budding yeast under glucose starvation. Mechanistically,
  4EBP1/2 promote ...
