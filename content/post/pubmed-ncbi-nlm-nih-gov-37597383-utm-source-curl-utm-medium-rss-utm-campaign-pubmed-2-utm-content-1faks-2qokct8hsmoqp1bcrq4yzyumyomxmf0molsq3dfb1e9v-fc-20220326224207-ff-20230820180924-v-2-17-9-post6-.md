description: Sulfasalazine has been identified as a candidate molecule to be investigated
  as an intervention to treat preterm pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. However, placental
  exposure of sulfasalazine and its systemically absorbed metabolite, sulfapyridine,
  is unknown. A robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method
  was developed and validated to simultaneously quantitate these analytes in human
  placenta with an application to a pilot clinical trial. The placental tissue ...
