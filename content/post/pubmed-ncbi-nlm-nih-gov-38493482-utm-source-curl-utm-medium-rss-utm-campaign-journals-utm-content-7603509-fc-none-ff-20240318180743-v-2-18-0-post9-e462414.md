description: In the setting of a learning collaborative, we conducted an international
  multicenter phase 2 clinical trial testing the hypothesis that non-myeloablative
  related haploidentical BMT with thiotepa and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)
  will result in 2-year event-free survival (no graft failure or death) of at least
  80%. A total of 70 participants (median age 19.1 (IQR 14.1 - 25.0) were evaluable
  based on the conditioning protocol. Graft failure occurred in 11.4% (8/70) and only
