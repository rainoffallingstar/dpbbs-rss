description: Mitochondria are central for cellular metabolism and energy supply. Barth
  syndrome (BTHS) is a severe disorder, due to dysfunction of the mitochondrial cardiolipin
  acyl transferase tafazzin. Altered cardiolipin remodeling affects mitochondrial
  inner membrane organization and function of membrane proteins such as transporters
  and the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Here, we describe a mouse model
  that carries a G197V exchange in tafazzin, corresponding to BTHS patients. ...
