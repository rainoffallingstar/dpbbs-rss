description: Accurate assessment of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is crucial
  for researching kidney disease in rats. Although validation of methods that assess
  GFR is crucial, large-scale comparisons between different methods is lacking. Both
  transcutaneous GFR (tGFR) and a newly developed estimated GFR (eGFR) equation by
  our group provide a low-invasive approach enabling repeated measurements. The tGFR
  is a single bolus method using FITC-labeled sinistrin to measure GFR based on half-life
  of ...
