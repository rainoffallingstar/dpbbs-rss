description: Linkage and candidate gene studies have identified several breast cancer
  susceptibility genes, but the overall contribution of coding variation to breast
  cancer is unclear. To evaluate the role of rare coding variants more comprehensively,
  we performed a meta-analysis across three large whole-exome sequencing datasets,
  containing 26,368 female cases and 217,673 female controls. Burden tests were performed
  for protein-truncating and rare missense variants in 15,616 and 18,601 genes, ...
