description: Older adults tend to exhibit longer response times than younger adults
  in choice tasks across cognitive domains, such as perception, attention, and memory.
  The diffusion model has emerged as a standard model for analyzing age differences
  in choice behavior. Applications of the diffusion model to choice data from younger
  and older adults indicate that age-related slowing is driven by a more cautious
  response style and slower non-decisional processes, rather than by age differences
  in the rate ...
