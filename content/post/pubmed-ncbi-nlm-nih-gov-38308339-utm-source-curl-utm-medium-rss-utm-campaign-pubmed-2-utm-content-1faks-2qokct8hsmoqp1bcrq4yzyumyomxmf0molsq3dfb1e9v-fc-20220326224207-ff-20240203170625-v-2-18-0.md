description: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are a powerful tool for detecting
  variants associated with complex traits and can help risk stratification and prevention
  strategies against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the strict
  significance threshold commonly used makes it likely that many true risk loci are
  missed. Functional annotation of GWAS polymorphisms is a proven strategy to identify
  additional risk loci. We aimed to investigate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)
