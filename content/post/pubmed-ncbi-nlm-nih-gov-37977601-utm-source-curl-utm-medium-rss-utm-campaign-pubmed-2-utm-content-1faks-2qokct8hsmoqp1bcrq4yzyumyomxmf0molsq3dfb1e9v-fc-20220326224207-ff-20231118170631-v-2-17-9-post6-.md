description: This Letter reports the observation of single top quarks produced together
  with a photon, which directly probes the electroweak coupling of the top quark.
  The analysis uses 139 fb^{-1} of 13 TeV proton-proton collision data collected with
  the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Requiring a photon with transverse
  momentum larger than 20 GeV and within the detector acceptance, the fiducial cross
  section is measured to be 688±23(stat) _{-71}^{+75}(syst) fb, to be compared with
