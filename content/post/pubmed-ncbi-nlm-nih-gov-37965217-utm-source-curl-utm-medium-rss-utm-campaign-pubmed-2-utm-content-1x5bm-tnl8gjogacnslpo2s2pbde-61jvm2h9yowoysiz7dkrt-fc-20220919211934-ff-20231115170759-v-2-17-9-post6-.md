description: Mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes disrupt neural
  network dynamics that ultimately lead to abnormal behavior. To understand how ASD-risk
  genes influence neural circuit computation during behavior, we analyzed the hippocampal
  network by performing large-scale cellular calcium imaging from hundreds of individual
  CA1 neurons simultaneously in transgenic mice with total knockout of the X-linked
  ASD-risk gene NEXMIF (neurite extension and migration factor). As NEXMIF knockout
