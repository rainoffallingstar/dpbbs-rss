description: The most important dose-limiting factor of the anthracycline idarubicin
  is the high risk of cardiotoxicity, in which the secondary alcohol metabolite idarubicinol
  plays an important role. It is not yet clear which enzymes are most important for
  the formation of idarubicinol and which inhibitors might be suitable to suppress
  this metabolic step and thus would be promising concomitant drugs to reduce idarubicin-associated
  cardiotoxicity. We, therefore, established and validated a mass ...
