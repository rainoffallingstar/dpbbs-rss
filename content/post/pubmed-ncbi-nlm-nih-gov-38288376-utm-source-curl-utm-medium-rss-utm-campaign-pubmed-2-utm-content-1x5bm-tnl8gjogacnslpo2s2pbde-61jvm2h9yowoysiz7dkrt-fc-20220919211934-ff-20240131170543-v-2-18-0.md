description: Analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a challenge
  due to its high dimensionality, sparsity and technical noise. Recognizing the benefits
  of dimensionality reduction in simplifying complexity and enhancing the signal-to-noise
  ratio, we introduce scBiG, a novel graph node embedding method designed for representation
  learning in scRNA-seq data. scBiG establishes a bipartite graph connecting cells
  and expressed genes, and then constructs a multilayer graph ...
