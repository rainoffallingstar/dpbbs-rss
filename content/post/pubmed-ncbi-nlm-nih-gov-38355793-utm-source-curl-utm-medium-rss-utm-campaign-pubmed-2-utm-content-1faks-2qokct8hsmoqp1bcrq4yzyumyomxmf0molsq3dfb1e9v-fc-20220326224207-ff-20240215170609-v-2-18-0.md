description: Genomic instability arising from defective responses to DNA damage¹ or
  mitotic chromosomal imbalances² can lead to the sequestration of DNA in aberrant
  extranuclear structures called micronuclei (MN). Although MN are a hallmark of ageing
  and diseases associated with genomic instability, the catalogue of genetic players
  that regulate the generation of MN remains to be determined. Here we analyse 997
  mouse mutant lines, revealing 145 genes whose loss significantly increases (n =
  71) or ...
