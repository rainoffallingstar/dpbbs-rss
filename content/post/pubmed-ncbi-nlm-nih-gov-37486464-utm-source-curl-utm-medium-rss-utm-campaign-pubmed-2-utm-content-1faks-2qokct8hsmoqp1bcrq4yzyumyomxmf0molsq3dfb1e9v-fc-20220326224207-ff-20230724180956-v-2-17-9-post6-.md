description: Despite treatment with statins, patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein
  cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides remain at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular
  events. Consequently, novel pharmaceutical drugs have been developed to control
  and modify the composition of blood lipids to ultimately prevent fatal cardiovascular
  events in patients with dyslipidaemia. This article reviews established and emerging
  lipid-lowering drugs regarding their mechanism of action, development ...
