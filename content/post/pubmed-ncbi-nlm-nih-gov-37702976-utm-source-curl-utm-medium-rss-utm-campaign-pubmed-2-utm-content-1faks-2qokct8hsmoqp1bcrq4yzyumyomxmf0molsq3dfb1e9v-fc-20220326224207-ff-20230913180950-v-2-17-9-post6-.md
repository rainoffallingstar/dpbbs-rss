description: Detailed knowledge of phylogeography is important for control of mosquito
  species involved in the transmission of human infectious diseases. Anopheles messeae
  is a geographically widespread and genetically diverse dominant vector of malaria
  in Eurasia. A closely related species, An. daciae, was originally distinguished
  from An. messeae based on five nucleotide substitutions in its ribosomal DNA (rDNA).
  However, the patterns of phylogeographic history of these species in Eurasia remain
