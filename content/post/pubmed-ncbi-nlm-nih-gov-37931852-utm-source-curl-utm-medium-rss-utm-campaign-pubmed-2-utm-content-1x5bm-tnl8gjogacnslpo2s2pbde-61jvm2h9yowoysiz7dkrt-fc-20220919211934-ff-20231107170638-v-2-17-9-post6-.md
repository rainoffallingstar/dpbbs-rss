description: Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly evolving field that enables researchers
  to capture comprehensive molecular profiles while preserving information about the
  physical locations. One major challenge in this research area involves the identification
  of spatial domains, which are distinct regions characterized by unique gene expression
  patterns. However, current unsupervised methods have struggled to perform well in
  this regard due to the presence of high levels of noise and dropout events ...
