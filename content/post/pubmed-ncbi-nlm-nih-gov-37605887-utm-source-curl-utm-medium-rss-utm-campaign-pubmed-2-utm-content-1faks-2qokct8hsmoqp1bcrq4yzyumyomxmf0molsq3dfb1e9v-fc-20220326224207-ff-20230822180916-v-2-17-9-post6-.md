description: Chemical reaction cycles are prototypical examples how to drive systems
  out of equilibrium and introduce novel, life-like properties into soft-matter systems.
  We report simulations of amphiphilic molecules in aqueous solution. The molecule's
  head group is permanently hydrophilic, whereas the reaction cycle switches the molecule's
  tail from hydrophilic (precursor) to hydrophobic (amphiphile) and vice versa. The
  reaction cycle leads to an arrest in coalescence and results in uniform vesicle
