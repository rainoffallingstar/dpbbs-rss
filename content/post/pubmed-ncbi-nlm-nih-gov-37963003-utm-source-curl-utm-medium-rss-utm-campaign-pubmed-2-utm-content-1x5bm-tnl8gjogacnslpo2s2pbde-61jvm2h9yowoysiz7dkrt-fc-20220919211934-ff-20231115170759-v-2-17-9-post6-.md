description: Cancer is one of the most challenging health problems worldwide. Accurate
  cancer survival prediction is vital for clinical decision making. Many deep learning
  methods have been proposed to understand the association between patients' genomic
  features and survival time. In most cases, the gene expression matrix is fed directly
  to the deep learning model. However, this approach completely ignores the interactions
  between biomolecules, and the resulting models can only learn the expression ...
