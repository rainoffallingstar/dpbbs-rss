description: Mammary gland growth and differentiation predominantly rely on stromal-epithelial
  cellular communication. Specifically, mammary adipocytes play a crucial role in
  ductal morphogenesis, as well as in the proliferation and differentiation of mammary
  epithelial cells. The process of lactation entails a reduction in the levels of
  white adipose tissue associated with the MG, allowing for the expansion of milk-producing
  epithelial cells. Subsequently, during involution and the regression of ...
