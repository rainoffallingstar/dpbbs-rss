description: The role of autologous-allogeneic tandem stem cell transplantation (alloTSCT)
  followed by maintenance as upfront treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) is controversial.
  Between 2008 and 2014 a total of 217 MM patients with a median age of 51 years were
  included by 20 German centers within an open-label, parallel-group, multi-center
  clinical trial to compare alloTSCT to auto tandem transplantation TSCT (autoTSCT)
  followed by a 2-year maintenance therapy with thalidomide (100 mg/d) in both arms
