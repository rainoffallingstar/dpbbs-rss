description: Neurological disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, as well as
  the neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease are accompanied
  or even powered by danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), defined as endogenous
  molecules released from stressed or damaged tissue. Besides protein-related DAMPs
  or "alarmins", numerous nucleic acid DAMPs exist in body fluids, such as cell-free
  nuclear and mitochondrial DNA as well as different species of extracellular RNA,
