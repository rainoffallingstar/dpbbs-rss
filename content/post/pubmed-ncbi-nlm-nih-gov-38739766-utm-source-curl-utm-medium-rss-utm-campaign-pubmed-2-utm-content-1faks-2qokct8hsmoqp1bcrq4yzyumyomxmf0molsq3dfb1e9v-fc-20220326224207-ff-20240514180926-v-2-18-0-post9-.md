description: Evidence from previous studies supports the concept that spinal cord
  injury (SCI)-induced neuropathic pain (NP) has its neural roots in the peripheral
  nervous system. There is uncertainty about how and to which degree mechanoreceptors
  contribute. Sensorimotor activation-based interventions (eg, treadmill training)
  have been shown to reduce NP after experimental SCI, suggesting transmission of
  pain-alleviating signals through mechanoreceptors. The aim of the present study
