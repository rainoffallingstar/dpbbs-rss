description: In cystic fibrosis (CF), Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection plays a critical
  role in disease progression. Although multiple studies suggest that airway commensals
  might be able to interfere with pathogenic bacteria, the role of the distinct commensals
  in the polymicrobial lung infections is largely unknown. In this study, we aimed
  to identify airway commensal bacteria that may inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa.
