description: Here, we describe the identification of two T-cell receptors (TRs) containing
  TRDV genes in their TRA chains, the first one in human and the second one in mouse.
  First, using 5'RACE on a mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell culture (MLTC), we identified
  TRDV1 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and complete coding sequence rearranged productively
  to TRAJ24. Single-cell TR RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the MLTC, conducted to identify
  additional clonotypes, revealed that the analysis software detected the ...
