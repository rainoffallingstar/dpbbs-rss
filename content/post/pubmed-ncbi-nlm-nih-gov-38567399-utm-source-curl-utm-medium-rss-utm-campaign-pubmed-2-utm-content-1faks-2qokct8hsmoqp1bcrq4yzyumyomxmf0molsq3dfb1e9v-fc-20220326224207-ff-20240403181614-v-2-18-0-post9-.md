description: Whereas monopodal self-assembling monolayers (SAMs) are most frequently
  used for surface and interface engineering, tripodal SAMs are less popular due to
  the difficulty in achieving a reliable and homogeneous bonding configuration. In
  this context, in the present study, the potential of phosphonic acid (PA) decorated
  triptycene (TripPA) for formation of SAMs on oxide substrates was studied, using
  indium tin oxide (ITO) as a representative and application-relevant test support.
