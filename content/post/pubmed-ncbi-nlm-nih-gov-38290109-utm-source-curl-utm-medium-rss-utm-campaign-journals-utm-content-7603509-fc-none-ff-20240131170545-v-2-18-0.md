description: Activation of von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a tightly controlled process
  governed primarily by local elements around its A1 domain. Recent studies suggest
  that the O-glycosylated sequences flanking the A1 domain constitute a discontinuous
  and force-sensitive autoinhibitory module (AIM), although its extent and conformation
  remains controversial. Here, we used a targeted screening strategy to identify two
  groups of nanobodies. One group, represented by clone 6D12, is conformation-insensitive
