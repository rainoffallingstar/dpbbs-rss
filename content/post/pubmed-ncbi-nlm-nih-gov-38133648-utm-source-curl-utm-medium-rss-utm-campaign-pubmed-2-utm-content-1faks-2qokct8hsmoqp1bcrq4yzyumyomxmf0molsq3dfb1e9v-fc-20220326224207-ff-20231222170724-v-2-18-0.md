description: The pinhole effect is commonly used to discriminate uncorrected refractive
  error from ocular diseases. A small aperture limits the width of light beams entering
  the eye, thus increasing the depth of focus. The pinhole effect has also been used
  in spectacles, contact lenses, corneal inlays, and intraocular lenses (IOLs) to
  improve reading by compensating for loss of accommodative function. Pinhole spectacles
  improve near visual acuity, but reduce reading speed, increase interblink interval,
