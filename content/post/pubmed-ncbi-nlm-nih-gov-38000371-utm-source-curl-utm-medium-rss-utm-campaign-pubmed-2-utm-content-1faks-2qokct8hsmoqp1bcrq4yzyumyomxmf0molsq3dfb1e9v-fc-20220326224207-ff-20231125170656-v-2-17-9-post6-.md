description: The DEAD-box helicase Dbp4 plays an essential role during the early assembly
  of the 40S ribosome, which is only poorly understood to date. By applying the yeast
  two-hybrid method and biochemical approaches, we discovered that Dbp4 interacts
  with the Efg1-Bud22 dimer. Both factors associate with early pre-90S particles and
  smaller complexes, each characterized by a high presence of the U14 snoRNA. A crosslink
  analysis of Bud22 revealed its contact to the U14 snoRNA and the 5' domain of ...
