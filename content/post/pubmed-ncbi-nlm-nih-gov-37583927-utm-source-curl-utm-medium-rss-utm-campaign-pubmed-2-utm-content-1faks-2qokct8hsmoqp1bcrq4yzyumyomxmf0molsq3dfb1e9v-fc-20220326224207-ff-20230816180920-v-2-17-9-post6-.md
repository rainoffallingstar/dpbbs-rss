description: Climate change is one of several drivers of recurrent outbreaks and geographical
  range expansion of infectious diseases in Europe. We propose a framework for the
  co-production of policy-relevant indicators and decision-support tools that track
  past, present, and future climate-induced disease risks across hazard, exposure,
  and vulnerability domains at the animal, human, and environmental interface. This
  entails the co-development of early warning and response systems and tools to assess
