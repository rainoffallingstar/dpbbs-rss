description: Innate immune memory allows macrophages to adequately respond to pathogens
  to which they have been pre-exposed. To what extent different pattern recognition
  receptors, cytokines and resolution signals influence innate immune memory needs
  further elucidation. The present study assessed whether lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  tolerance in monocytes and macrophages is affected by these factors. Human CD14^(+)
  cells were isolated from peripheral blood, stimulated by LPS and re-stimulated after
  3 days ...
