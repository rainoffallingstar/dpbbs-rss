description: Short-wave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence could become the new gold standard
  in optical imaging for biomedical applications due to important advantages such
  as lack of autofluorescence, weak photon absorption by blood and tissues, and reduced
  photon scattering coefficient. Therefore, contrary to the visible and NIR regions,
  tissues become translucent in the SWIR region. Nevertheless, the lack of bright
