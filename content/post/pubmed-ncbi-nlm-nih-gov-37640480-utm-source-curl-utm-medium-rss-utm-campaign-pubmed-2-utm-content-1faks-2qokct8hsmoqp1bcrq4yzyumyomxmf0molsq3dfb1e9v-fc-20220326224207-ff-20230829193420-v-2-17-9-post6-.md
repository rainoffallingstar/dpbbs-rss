description: 'CONCLUSIONS: These data show that single low-dose Doxil can substantially
  enhance the RT/αPD-1-induced abscopal effect, with a strong increase in cross-presenting
  DCs and CD8^(+) tumor-specific T cells particularly in abscopal tumors compared
  with RT/αPD-1 and Doxil/αPD-1. Moreover, they indicate that the mtDNA/cGAS/STING/IFN-I
  axis is important for the immunogenic/immunomodulatory doxorubicin effects. Our
  ﬁndings may be helpful for the planning of clinical radiochemoimmunotherapy trials
