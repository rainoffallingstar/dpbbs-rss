description: Microsatellite-unstable (MSI) cancers require WRN helicase to resolve
  replication stress due to expanded DNA (TA)n-dinucleotide repeats. WRN is a promising
  synthetic lethal target for MSI tumours, and WRN inhibitors are in development.
  Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 base editing to map WRN residues critical for MSI cells,
  validating the helicase domain as the primary drug target. Fragment-based screening
  led to the development of potent and highly selective WRN helicase covalent inhibitors.
