description: Childhood maltreatment (CM) is known to influence brain development.
  To obtain a better understanding of related brain alterations, recent research has
  focused on the influence of the type and timing of CM. We aimed to investigate the
  association between type and timing of CM and local brain volume. Anatomical magnetic
  resonance images were collected from 93 participants (79 female/14 male) with a
  history of CM. CM history was assessed with the German Interview Version of the
  "Maltreatment ...
