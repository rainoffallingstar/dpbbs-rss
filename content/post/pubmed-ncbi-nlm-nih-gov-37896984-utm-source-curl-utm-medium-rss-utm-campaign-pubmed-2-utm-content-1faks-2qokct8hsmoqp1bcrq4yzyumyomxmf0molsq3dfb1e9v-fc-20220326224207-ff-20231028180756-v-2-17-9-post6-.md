description: Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a large family of viruses with a capsid
  composed of the L1 and L2 proteins, which bind to receptors of the basal epithelial
  cells and promote virus entry. The majority of sexually active people become exposed
  to HPV and the virus is the most common cause of cervical cancer. Vaccines are available
  based on the L1 protein, which self-assembles and forms virus-like particles (VLPs)
  when expressed in yeast and insect cells. Although very effective, these ...
