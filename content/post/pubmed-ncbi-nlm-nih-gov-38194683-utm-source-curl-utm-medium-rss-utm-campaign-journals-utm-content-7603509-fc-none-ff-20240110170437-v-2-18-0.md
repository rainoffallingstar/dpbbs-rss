description: TKIs are standard therapy for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.
  Each of these drugs has a specific profile of tyrosine kinases they inhibit and,
  while all clinically effective, they each have unique toxicity profiles. With the
  introduction of ponatinib, arterio-occlusive events were first noted and later found
  to occur with all TKIs to various extents. The recognition of this "class effect"
  was delayed considering ponatinib was introduced ten years following the introduction
