description: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) associated with left heart failure (LHF)
  (PH-LHF) is one of the most common causes of PH. It directly contributes to symptoms
  and reduced functional capacity and negatively affects right heart function, ultimately
  leading to a poor prognosis. There are no specific treatments for PH-LHF, despite
  the high number of drugs tested so far. This scientific document addresses the main
  knowledge gaps in PH-LHF with emphasis on pathophysiology and clinical trials. ...
