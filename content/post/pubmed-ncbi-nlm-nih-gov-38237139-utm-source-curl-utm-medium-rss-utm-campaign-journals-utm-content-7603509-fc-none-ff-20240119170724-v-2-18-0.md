description: Escape from immune surveillance is a hallmark of cancer. Immune deregulation
  caused by intrinsic and extrinsic cellular factors, such as altered T cell functions,
  leads to immune exhaustion, loss of immune surveillance, and clonal proliferation
  of tumoral cells. The T cell immune system contributes to the pathogenesis, maintenance,
  and progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Here, we comprehensively reviewed
  our current biological knowledge of the T cell compartment in MDS and ...
