description: Tacrolimus is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and is susceptible
  to interactions with the CYP3A and P-glycoprotein inducer St. John's Wort (SJW).
  CYP3A isozymes are predominantly expressed in the small intestine and liver. Prolonged-release
  tacrolimus (PR-Tac) is largely absorbed in distal intestinal segments and is less
  susceptible to CYP3A inhibition. The effect of induction by SJW is unknown. In this
  randomized, crossover trial, 18 healthy volunteers received single oral ...
