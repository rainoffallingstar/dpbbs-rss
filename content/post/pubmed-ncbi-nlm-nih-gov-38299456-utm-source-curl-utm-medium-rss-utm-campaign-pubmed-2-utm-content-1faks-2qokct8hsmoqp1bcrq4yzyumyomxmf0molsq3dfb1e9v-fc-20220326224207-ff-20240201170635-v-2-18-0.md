description: The structure and dynamics of F-actin networks in the cortical area of
  B cells control the signal efficiency of B-cell antigen receptors (BCRs). Although
  antigen-induced signaling has been studied extensively, the role of cortical F-actin
  in antigen-independent tonic BCR signaling is less well understood. Because these
  signals are essential for the survival of B cells and are consequently exploited
  by several B-cell lymphomas, we assessed how the cortical F-actin structure influences
