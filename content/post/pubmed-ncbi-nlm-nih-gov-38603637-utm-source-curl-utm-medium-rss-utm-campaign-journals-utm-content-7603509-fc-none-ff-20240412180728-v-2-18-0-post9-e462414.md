description: Use of surrogates as primary endpoints is commonplace in hematology/oncology
  clinical trials. As opposed to prognostic markers, surrogates are endpoints that
  can be measured early and yet can still capture the full effect of treatment, as
  it would be captured by the true outcome (e.g., overall survival). We discuss the
  level of evidence of the most commonly used endpoints in hematology and share recommendations
