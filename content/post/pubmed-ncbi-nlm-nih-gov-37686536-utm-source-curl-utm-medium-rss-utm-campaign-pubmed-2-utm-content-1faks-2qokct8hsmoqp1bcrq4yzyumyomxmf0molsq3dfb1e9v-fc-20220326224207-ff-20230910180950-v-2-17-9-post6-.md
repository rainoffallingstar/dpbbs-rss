description: Survival studies are important tools for cancer control, but long-term
  survival data on high-quality cancer registries are lacking for all cancers, including
  prostate (PC), testicular (TC), and penile cancers. Using generalized additive models
  and data from the NORDCAN database, we analyzed 1- and 5-year relative survival
  for these cancers in Denmark (DK), Finland (FI), Norway (NO), and Sweden (SE) over
  a 50-year period (1971-2020). We additionally estimated conditional 5/1-year survival
