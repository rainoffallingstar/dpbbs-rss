description: Cell-generated forces play a major role in coordinating the large-scale
  behavior of cell assemblies, in particular during development, wound healing and
  cancer. Mechanical signals propagate faster than biochemical signals, but can have
  similar effects, especially in epithelial tissues with strong cell-cell adhesion.
  However, a quantitative description of the transmission chain from force generation
