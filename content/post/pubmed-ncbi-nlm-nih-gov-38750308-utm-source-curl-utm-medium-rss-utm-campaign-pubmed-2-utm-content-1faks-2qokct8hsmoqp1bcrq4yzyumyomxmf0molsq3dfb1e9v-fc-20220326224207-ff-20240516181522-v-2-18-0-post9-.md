description: Necroptosis is a lytic form of regulated cell death reported to contribute
  to inflammatory diseases of the gut, skin and lung, as well as ischemic-reperfusion
  injuries of the kidney, heart and brain. However, precise identification of the
  cells and tissues that undergo necroptotic cell death in vivo has proven challenging
  in the absence of robust protocols for immunohistochemical detection. Here, we provide
  automated immunohistochemistry protocols to detect core necroptosis regulators ...
