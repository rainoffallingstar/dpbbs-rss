description: Malaria transmission intensity affects the development of naturally acquired
  immunity to malaria. An absolute correlate measure of protection against malaria
  is lacking. However, antibody-mediated functions against Plasmodium falciparum correlate
  with protection against malaria. In children, antibody-mediated functions against
  P. falciparum decline with reduced exposure. It is unclear whether adults maintain
  antibody-mediated functions as malaria transmission declines. This study ...
