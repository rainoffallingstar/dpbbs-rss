description: Paclitaxel (PTX) is a potent anticancer drug. However, PTX exhibits extremely
  poor solubility in aqueous solution along with severe side effects. Therefore, in
  this study, an inclusion complex was prepared between PTX and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
  (HPβCD) by solvent evaporation to enhance the drug's solubility. The HPβCD-PTX inclusion
  complex was then encapsulated in poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) to fabricate drug-loaded
  nanoparticles (HPβCD-PTX/PHB NPs) by nanoprecipitation. The ...
