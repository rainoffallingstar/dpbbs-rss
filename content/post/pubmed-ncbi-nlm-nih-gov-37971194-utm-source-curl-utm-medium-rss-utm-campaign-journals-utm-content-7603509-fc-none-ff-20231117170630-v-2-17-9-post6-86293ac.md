description: Concurrent BTK and BCL2 inhibition has not been investigated in Waldenström
  macroglobulinemia. We performed an investigator-initiated trial of ibrutinib and
  venetoclax in symptomatic, treatment-naive patients with MYD88-mutated WM. Patients
  received ibrutinib 420 mg once daily (cycle 1), followed by a ramp-up of venetoclax
  to 400 mg daily (cycle 2). The combination was then administered for 22 additional
  four-week cycles. Attainment of VGPR was the primary endpoint. Forty-five patients
