description: Excessive STAT3 signalling via gp130, the shared receptor subunit for
  IL-6 and IL-11, contributes to disease progression and poor survival outcomes in
  patients with colorectal cancer. Here, we provide evidence that bazedoxifene inhibits
  tumour growth via direct interaction with the gp130 receptor to suppress IL-6 and
  IL-11-mediated STAT3 signalling. Additionally, bazedoxifene combined with chemotherapy
  synergistically reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in patient-derived
