description: This study aimed to determine the values of the half-effective dose (ED(50))
  and 95% effective dose (ED(95)) of remimazolam besylate used in the procedural sedation
  of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Sixty patients who fulfilled
  the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study were selected. Sufentanil was
  administered intravenously and remimazolam besylate was administered 2 min later.
  ERCP treatment was feasible when the modified alertness/sedation (MOAA/S) score
