  to therapeutic pressure, we performed an epigenomic analysis of 132 matched initial
  and recurrent tumors from patients with IDH-wildtype (IDHwt) and IDH-mutant (IDHmut)
  glioma. IDHwt gliomas showed a stable epigenome over time with relatively low levels
  of global methylation. The epigenome of IDHmut gliomas showed initial high levels
