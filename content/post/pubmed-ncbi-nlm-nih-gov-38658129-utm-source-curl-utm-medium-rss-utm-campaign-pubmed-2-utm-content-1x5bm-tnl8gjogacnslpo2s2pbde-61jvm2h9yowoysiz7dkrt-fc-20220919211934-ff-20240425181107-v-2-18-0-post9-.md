description: High-throughput technologies are becoming increasingly important in discovering
  prognostic biomarkers and in identifying novel drug targets. With Mammaprint, Oncotype
  DX, and many other prognostic molecular signatures breast cancer is one of the paradigmatic
  examples of the utility of high-throughput data to deliver prognostic biomarkers,
  that can be represented in a form of a rather short gene list. Such gene lists can
