description: Blood cells contain functionally important intracellular structures,
  such as granules, critical to immunity and thrombosis. Quantitative variation in
  these structures has not been subjected previously to large-scale genetic analysis.
  We perform genome-wide association studies of 63 flow-cytometry derived cellular
  phenotypes-including cell-type specific measures of granularity, nucleic acid content
  and reactivity-in 41,515 participants in the INTERVAL study. We identify 2172 ...
