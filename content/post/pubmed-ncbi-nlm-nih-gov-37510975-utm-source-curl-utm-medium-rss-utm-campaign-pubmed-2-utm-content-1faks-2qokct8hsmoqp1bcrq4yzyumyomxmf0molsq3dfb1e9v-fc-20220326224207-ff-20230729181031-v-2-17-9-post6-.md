description: We hypothesize that (1) a significant pre-ECMO liver impairment, which
  is evident in the presence of pre-ECMO acute liver injury and a higher pre-ECMO
  MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) score, is associated with increased mortality;
  and (2) the requirement of veno-veno-arterial (V-VA) ECMO support is linked to a
  higher prevalence of pre-ECMO acute liver injury, a higher pre-ECMO MELD score,
  and increased mortality. We analyze 187 ECMO runs (42 V-VA and 145 veno-venous (V-V)
  ECMO) ...
