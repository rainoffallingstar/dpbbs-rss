description: This report demonstrates a novel class of innate immune cells designated
  "variable immunoreceptor-expressing myeloids" (VIREMs). Using single-cell transcriptomics
  and genome-wide epigenetic profiling, we establish that VIREMs are myeloid cells
  unrelated to lymphocytes. We visualize the phenotype of B-VIREMs that are capable
  of genetically recombining and expressing antibody genes, the exclusive hallmark
  function of B lymphocytes. These cells, designated B-VIREMs, display monoclonal
  antibody ...
