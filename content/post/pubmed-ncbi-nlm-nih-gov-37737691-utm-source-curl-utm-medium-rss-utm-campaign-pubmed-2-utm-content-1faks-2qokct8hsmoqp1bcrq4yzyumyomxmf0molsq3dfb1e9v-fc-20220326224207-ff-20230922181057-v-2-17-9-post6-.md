description: Diffuse gliomas in adults encompass a heterogenous group of central nervous
  system neoplasms. In recent years, extensive (epi-)genomic profiling has identified
  several glioma subgroups characterized by distinct molecular characteristics, most
  importantly IDH1/2 and histone H3 mutations. A group of 16 diffuse gliomas classified
  as "adult-type diffuse high-grade glioma, IDH-wildtype, subtype F (HGG-F)" was identified
  by the DKFZ v12.5 Brain Tumor Classifier. Histopathologic characterization, ...
