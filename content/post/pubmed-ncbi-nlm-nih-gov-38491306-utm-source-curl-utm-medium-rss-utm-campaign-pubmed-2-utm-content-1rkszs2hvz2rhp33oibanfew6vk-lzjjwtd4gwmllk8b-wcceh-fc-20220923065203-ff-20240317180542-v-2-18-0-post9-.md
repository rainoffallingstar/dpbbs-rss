description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD22 (CD22-CAR) provide
  a therapeutic option for patients with CD22^(+) malignancies with progression after
  CD19-directed therapies. Using on-site, automated, closed-loop manufacturing, we
  conducted parallel Phase 1b clinical trials investigating a humanized CD22-CAR with
  41BB costimulatory domain in children and adults with heavily treated, relapsed/refractory
  (r/r) B-ALL. Of 19 patients enrolled, 18 had successful CD22-CAR manufacturing,
