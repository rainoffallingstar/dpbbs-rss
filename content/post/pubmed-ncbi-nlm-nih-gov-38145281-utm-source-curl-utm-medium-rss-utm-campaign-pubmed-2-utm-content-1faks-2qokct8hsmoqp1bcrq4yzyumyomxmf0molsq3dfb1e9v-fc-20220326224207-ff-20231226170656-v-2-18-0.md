description: Feed-forward inhibition is vital in the transfer and processing of synaptic
  information within the hippocampal-entorhinal loop by controlling the strength and
  direction of excitation flow between different neuronal populations and individual
  neurons. While the cellular targets in the hippocampus that receive excitatory inputs
  from the entorhinal cortex have been well studied, and the role of feedforward inhibitory
  neurons has been attributed to neurogliafom cells, the cortical ...
