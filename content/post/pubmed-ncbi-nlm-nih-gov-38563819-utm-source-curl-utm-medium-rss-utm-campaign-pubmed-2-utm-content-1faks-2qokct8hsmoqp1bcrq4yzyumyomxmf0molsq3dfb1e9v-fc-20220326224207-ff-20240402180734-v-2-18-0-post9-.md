description: The outcome of cancer and autoimmunity is often dictated by the effector
  functions of CD4+ conventional T cells (Tconv). Although activation of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway has long been implicated in Tconv biology, the cell-autonomous
  roles of the separate NF-κB transcription-factor subunits are unknown. Here, we
  dissected the contributions of the canonical NF-κB subunits RelA and c-Rel to Tconv
  function. RelA, rather than c-Rel, regulated Tconv activation and cytokine production
