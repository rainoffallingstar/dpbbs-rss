description: A simple and sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous quantification
  of the second-generation antidepressant sertraline, and its active metabolite, N-desmethylsertraline,
  in human plasma was developed and validated. The analytes were extracted from 200
  µL human plasma using a simple protein precipitation method. A gradient elution
  mode of water and 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile was used for chromatographic
  separation on a Poroshell EC-C18 column (3 × 100 mm, 2.7 µm) at a flow rate ...
