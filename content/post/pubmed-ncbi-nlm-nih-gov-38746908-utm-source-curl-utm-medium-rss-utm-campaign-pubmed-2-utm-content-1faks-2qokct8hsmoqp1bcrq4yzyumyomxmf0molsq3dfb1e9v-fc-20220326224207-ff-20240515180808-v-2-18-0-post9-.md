description: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) plays a pivotal role in the
  diagnosis and management of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), particularly given
  the approval of antifibrotic agents for conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
  and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Diagnosing fibrotic pulmonary disorders through
  HRCT involves a detailed and methodical examination. The identification of specific
  lung tissue changes, including ground-glass opacities and reticulation, along with
