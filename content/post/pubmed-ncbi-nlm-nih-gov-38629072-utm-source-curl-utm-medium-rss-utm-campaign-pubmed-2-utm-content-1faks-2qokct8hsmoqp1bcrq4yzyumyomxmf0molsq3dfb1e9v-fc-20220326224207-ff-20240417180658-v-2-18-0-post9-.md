description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is typically diagnosed at advanced
  stages and associated with early distant metastasis and poor survival. Besides clinical
  factors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) emerged as a crucial determinant of patient
  survival and therapy response in many tumors, including PDAC. Thus, the presence
  of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures
  (TLS) is associated with longer survival in PDAC. Although neoadjuvant therapy ...
