description: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiation therapy (MRIgRT) has improved
  soft tissue contrast over computed tomography (CT) based image-guided RT. Superior
  visualization of the target and surrounding radiosensitive structures has the potential
  to improve oncological outcomes partly due to safer dose-escalation and adaptive
  planning. In this review, we highlight the workflow of adaptive MRIgRT planning,
  which includes simulation imaging, daily MRI, identifying isocenter shifts, contouring,
