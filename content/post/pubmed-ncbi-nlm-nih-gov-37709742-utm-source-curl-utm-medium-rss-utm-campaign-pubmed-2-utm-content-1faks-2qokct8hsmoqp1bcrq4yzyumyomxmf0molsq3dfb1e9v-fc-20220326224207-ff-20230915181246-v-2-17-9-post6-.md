description: PHT1 is a histidine /oligopeptide transporter with an essential role
  in Toll-like receptor innate immune responses. It can act as a receptor by recruiting
  the adaptor protein TASL which leads to type I interferon production via IRF5. Persistent
  stimulation of this signalling pathway is known to be involved in the pathogenesis
  of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Understanding how PHT1 recruits TASL at the
  molecular level, is therefore clinically important for the development of ...
