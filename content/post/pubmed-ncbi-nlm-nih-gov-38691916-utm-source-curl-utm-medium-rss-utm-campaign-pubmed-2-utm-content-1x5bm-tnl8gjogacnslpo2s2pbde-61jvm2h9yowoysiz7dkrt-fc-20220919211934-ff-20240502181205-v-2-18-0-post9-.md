description: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder intricately
  linked to genetic factors, with numerous approaches having identified genes linked
  to its development, diagnosis and prognosis. Despite genome-wide association analysis
  and gene knockout experiments confirming some genes associated with SLE, there are
  still numerous potential genes yet to be discovered. The search for relevant genes
  through biological experiments entails significant financial and human resources.
