description: Thermus thermophilus bacteriophage P23-45 encodes a giant 5,002-residue
  tail tape measure protein (TMP) that defines the length of its extraordinarily long
  tail. Here, we show that the N-terminal portion of P23-45 TMP is an unusual RNA
  polymerase (RNAP) homologous to cellular RNAPs. The TMP-fused virion RNAP transcribes
  pre-early phage genes, including a gene that encodes another, non-virion RNAP, that
  transcribes early and some middle phage genes. We report the crystal structures
  of both ...
