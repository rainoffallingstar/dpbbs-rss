description: Biomedical single-cell atlases describe disease at the cellular level.
  However, analysis of this data commonly focuses on cell-type centric pairwise cross-condition
  comparisons, disregarding the multicellular nature of disease processes. Here we
  propose multicellular factor analysis for the unsupervised analysis of samples from
  cross-condition single-cell atlases and the identification of multicellular programs
  associated with disease. Our strategy, which repurposes group factor analysis ...
