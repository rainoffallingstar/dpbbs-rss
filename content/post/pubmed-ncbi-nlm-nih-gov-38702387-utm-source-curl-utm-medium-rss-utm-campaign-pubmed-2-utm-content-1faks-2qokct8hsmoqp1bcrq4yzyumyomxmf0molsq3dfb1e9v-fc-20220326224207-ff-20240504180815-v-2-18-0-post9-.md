description: Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables imaging scientists
  to visualize biological structures with unprecedented resolution. Particularly powerful
  implementations of SMLM are capable of three-dimensional, multicolor and high-throughput
  imaging and can yield key biological insights. However, widespread access to these
  technologies is limited, primarily by the cost of commercial options and complexity
  of de novo development of custom systems. Here we provide a comprehensive ...
