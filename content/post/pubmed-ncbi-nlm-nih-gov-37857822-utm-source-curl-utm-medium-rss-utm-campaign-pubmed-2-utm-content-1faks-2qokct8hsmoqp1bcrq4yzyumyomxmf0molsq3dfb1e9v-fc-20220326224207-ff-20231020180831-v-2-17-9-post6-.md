description: Glutaminase (GLS), which deaminates glutamine to form glutamate, is a
  mitochondrial tetrameric protein complex. Although inorganic phosphate (Pi) is known
  to promote GLS filamentation and activation, the molecular basis of this mechanism
  is unknown. Here we aimed to determine the molecular mechanism of Pi-induced mouse
  GLS filamentation and its impact on mitochondrial physiology. Single-particle cryogenic
  electron microscopy revealed an allosteric mechanism in which Pi binding at the
