description: The orchestrated assembly of actin and actin-binding proteins into cytoskeletal
  structures coordinates cell morphology changes during migration, cytokinesis, and
  adaptation to external stimuli. The accurate and unbiased visualization of the diverse
  actin assemblies within cells is an ongoing challenge. We describe here the identification
  and use of designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) as synthetic actin binders.
  Actin-binding DARPins were identified through ribosome display and ...
