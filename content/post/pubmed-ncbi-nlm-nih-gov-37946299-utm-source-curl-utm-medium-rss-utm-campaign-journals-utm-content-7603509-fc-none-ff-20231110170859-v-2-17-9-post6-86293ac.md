description: State-of-the-art response assessment of central nervous system lymphoma
  (CNSL) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging and an insufficient predictor
  of treatment outcomes. Accordingly, the development of novel risk stratification
  strategies in CNSL is a high unmet medical need. We applied ultrasensitive circulating
  tumor (ct)DNA sequencing to 146 plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from
  67 patients, aiming to develop an entirely noninvasive dynamic risk model ...
