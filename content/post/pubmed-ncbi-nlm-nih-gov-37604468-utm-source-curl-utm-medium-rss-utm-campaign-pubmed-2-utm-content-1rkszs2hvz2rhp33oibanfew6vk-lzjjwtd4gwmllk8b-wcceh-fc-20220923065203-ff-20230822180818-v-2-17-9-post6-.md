description: Leptospirosis is typically a self-limited febrile illness; when it occurs,
  meningitis usually develops early in the course. Here, we describe a patient who
  had engaged in freshwater activities in Kauai that was immunocompromised due to
  a history of mantle cell lymphoma, autologous hematopoietic cell transplant, and
  hypogammaglobulinemia. He developed leptospiral meningoencephalitis 11 weeks after
  illness onset and persistently detectable Leptospira DNA in blood and cerebrospinal
  fluid along ...
