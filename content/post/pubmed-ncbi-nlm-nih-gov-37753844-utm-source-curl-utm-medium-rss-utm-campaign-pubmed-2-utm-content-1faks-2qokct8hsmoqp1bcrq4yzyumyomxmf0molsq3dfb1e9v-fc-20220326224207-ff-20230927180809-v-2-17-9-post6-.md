description: 'CONCLUSION: Our work demonstrates the feasibility of multi-echo-based
  fat-water separation with an adaptive fat model for fat artifact correction for
  CEST MRI at 7 T. Our approach provided better fat artifact correction throughout
  the entire spectrum and image than the fat saturation pulse or Z-spectrum-based
  correction method for both phantom and knee imaging ...'
