description: Acute hyper-hemolysis is a severe life-threatening complication in patients
  with sickle cell disease (SCD) that may occur during delayed hemolytic transfusion
  reaction (DHTR), or vaso-occlusive crises associated with multi-organ failure. Here,
  we developed in vitro and in vivo animal models to mimic endothelial damage during
  the early phase of hyper-hemolysis in SCD. We then used the carbon monoxide (CO)-releasing
  molecule CORM-401 and examined its effects against endothelial activation, ...
