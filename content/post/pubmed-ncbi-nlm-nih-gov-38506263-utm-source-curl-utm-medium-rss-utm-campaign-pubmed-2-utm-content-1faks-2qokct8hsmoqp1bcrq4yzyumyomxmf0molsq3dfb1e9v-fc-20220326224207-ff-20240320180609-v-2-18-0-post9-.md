description: Discussed are two picolinate appended bispidine ligands (3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane
  derivatives) in comparison with an earlier described bis-pyridine derivative, which
  are all known to strongly bind CuII. The radiopharmacological characterization of
  the two isomeric bispidine complexes includes quantitative labeling with 64CuII
  at ambient conditions with high radiochemical purities and yields (molar activities
  > 200 MBq/nmol). Challenge experiments in presence of EDTA, cyclam, human serum
