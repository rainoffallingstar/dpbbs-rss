description: We demonstrate that a sodium dimer, Na_{2}(1^{3}Σ_{u}^{+}), residing
  on the surface of a helium nanodroplet, can be set into rotation by a nonresonant
  1.0 ps infrared laser pulse. The time-dependent degree of alignment measured, exhibits
  a periodic, gradually decreasing structure that deviates qualitatively from that
  expected for gas-phase dimers. Comparison to alignment dynamics calculated from
  the time-dependent rotational Schrödinger equation shows that the deviation is due
  to the ...
