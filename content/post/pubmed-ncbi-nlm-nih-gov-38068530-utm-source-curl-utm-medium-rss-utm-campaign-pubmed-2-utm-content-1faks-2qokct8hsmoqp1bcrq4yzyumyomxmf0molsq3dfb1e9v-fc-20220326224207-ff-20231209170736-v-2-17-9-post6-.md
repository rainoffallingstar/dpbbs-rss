description: 'CONCLUSION: This study replicated the good consolidation rates reported
  in the literature with screws, plates, intramedullary nails or staples in arthrodesis
  of the adolescent foot in neurologically healthy subjects and confirmed the efficacy
  of K-wires. The main advantages of transcutaneous K-wire treatment are easy metal
  removal, lower osteosynthesis material costs and less concomitant damage. Further
  studies, especially randomised controlled trials, are needed to further investigate
