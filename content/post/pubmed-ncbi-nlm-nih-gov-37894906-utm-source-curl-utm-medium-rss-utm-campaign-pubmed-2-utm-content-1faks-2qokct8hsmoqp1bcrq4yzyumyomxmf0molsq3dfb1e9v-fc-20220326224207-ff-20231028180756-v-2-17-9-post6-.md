description: Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked chorioretinal dystrophy leading to
  progressive retinal degeneration that results in blindness by late adulthood. It
  is caused by mutations in the CHM gene encoding the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP1),
  which plays a crucial role in the prenylation of Rab proteins ensuring correct intracellular
  trafficking. Gene augmentation is a promising therapeutic strategy, and there are
