description: Converging evidence increasingly suggests that psychiatric disorders,
  such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are
  not unitary diseases, but rather heterogeneous syndromes that involve diverse, co-occurring
  symptoms and divergent responses to treatment. This clinical heterogeneity has hindered
  the progress of precision diagnosis and treatment effectiveness in psychiatric disorders.
