description: Inhibition of K-RAS effectors like B-RAF or MEK1/2 is accompanied by
  treatment resistance in cancer patients via re-activation of PI3K and Wnt signaling.
  We hypothesised that myotubularin-related-protein-7 (MTMR7), which inhibits PI3K
  and ERK1/2 signaling downstream of RAS, directly targets RAS and thereby prevents
  resistance. Using cell and structural biology combined with animal studies, we show
  that MTMR7 binds and inhibits RAS at cellular membranes. Overexpression of MTMR7
  reduced RAS ...
