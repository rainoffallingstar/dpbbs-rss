description: Large DNA viruses in the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, sometimes referred
  to as "giant viruses" owing to their large genomes and virions, have been the subject
  of burgeoning interest over the last decade. Here, we describe recently adopted
  taxonomic updates for giant viruses within the order Imitervirales. The families
  Allomimiviridae, Mesomimiviridae, and Schizomimiviridae have been created to accommodate
  the increasing diversity of mimivirus relatives that have sometimes been referred
