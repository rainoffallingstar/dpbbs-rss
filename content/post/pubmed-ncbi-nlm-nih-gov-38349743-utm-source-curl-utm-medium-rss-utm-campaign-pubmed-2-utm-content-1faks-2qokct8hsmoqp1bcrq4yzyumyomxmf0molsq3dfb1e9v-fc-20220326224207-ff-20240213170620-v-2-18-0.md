description: Light-triggered molecular switches are extensively researched for their
  applications in medicine, chemistry and material science and, if combined, particularly
  for their use in multifunctional smart materials, for which orthogonally, i.e. individually,
  addressable photoswitches are needed. In such a multifunctional mixture, the switching
  properties, efficiencies and the overall performance may be impaired by undesired
  mutual dependences of the photoswitches on each other. Within this study, ...
