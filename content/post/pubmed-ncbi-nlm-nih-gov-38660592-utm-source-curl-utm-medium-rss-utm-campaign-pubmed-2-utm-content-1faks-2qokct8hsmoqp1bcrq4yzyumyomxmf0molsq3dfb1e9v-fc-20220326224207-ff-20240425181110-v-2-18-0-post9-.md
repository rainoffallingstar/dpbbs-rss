description: Traumatic experiences and fetal development influence tryptophan (TRP)
  and its neuroactive byproduct, kynurenic acid (KYNA). Maternal TRP metabolite levels
  during pregnancy vary by fetal sex, with higher concentrations in mothers carrying
  male fetuses. This pilot study aimed to explore the relationship between offspring
  sex, maternal childhood trauma, and maternal salivary KYNA and TRP levels during
  pregnancy. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to
