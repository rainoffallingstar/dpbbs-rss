description: Point mutations in the α-synuclein coding gene may lead to the development
  of Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is often accompanied by other psychiatric conditions,
  such as anxiety, depression, and drug use disorders, which typically emerge in adulthood.
  Some of these point mutations, such as SNCA and A30T, have been linked to behavioral
  effects that are not commonly associated with PD, especially regarding alcohol consumption
  patterns. In this study, we investigated whether the familial PD ...
