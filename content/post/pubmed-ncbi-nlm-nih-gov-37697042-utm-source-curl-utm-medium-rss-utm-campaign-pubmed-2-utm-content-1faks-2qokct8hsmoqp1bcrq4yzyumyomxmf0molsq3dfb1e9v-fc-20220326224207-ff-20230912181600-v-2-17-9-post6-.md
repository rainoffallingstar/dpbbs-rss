description: Developments in computational omics technologies have provided new means
  to access the hidden diversity of natural products, unearthing new potential for
  drug discovery. In parallel, artificial intelligence approaches such as machine
  learning have led to exciting developments in the computational drug design field,
  facilitating biological activity prediction and de novo drug design for molecular
  targets of interest. Here, we describe current and future synergies between these
  developments ...
