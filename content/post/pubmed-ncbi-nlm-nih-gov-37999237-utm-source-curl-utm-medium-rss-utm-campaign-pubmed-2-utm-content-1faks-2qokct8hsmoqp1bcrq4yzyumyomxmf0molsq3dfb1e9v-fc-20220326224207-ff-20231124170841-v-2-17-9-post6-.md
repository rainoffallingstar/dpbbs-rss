description: Two siblings showed increased galactose and galactose-related metabolites
  in neonatal screening. Diagnostic workup did not reveal abnormalities in any of
  the known disease-causing enzymes involved in galactose metabolism. Using whole-exome
  sequencing, we identified a homozygous missense variant in PPA1 encoding the cytosolic
  pyrophosphatase 1 (PPA1), c.557C>T (p.Thr186Ile). The enzyme activity of PPA1 was
  determined using a colorimetric assay, and the protein content was visualized via
