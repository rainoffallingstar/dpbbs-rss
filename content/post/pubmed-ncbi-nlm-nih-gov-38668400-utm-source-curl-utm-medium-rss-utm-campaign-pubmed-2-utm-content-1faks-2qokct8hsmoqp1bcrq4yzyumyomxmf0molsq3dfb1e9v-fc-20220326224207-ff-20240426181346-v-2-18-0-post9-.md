description: This study introduces an application of innovative medical technology,
  Photon Counting Computer Tomography (PC CT) with novel detectors, for the assessment
  of shunt valves. PC CT technology offers enhanced visualization capabilities, especially
  for small structures, and opens up new possibilities for detailed three-dimensional
  imaging. Shunt valves are implanted under the skin and redirect excess cerebrospinal
  fluid, for example, to the abdominal cavity through a catheter. They play a vital
