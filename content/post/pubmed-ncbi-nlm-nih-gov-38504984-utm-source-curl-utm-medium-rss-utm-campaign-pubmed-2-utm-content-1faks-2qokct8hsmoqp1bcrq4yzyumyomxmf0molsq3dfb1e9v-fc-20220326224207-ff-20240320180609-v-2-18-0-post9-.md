description: Encoded by PTPN11, the Src-homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2
  (SHP2) integrates signals from various membrane-bound receptors such as receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs), cytokine and integrin receptors and thereby promotes cell
  survival and proliferation. Activating mutations in the PTPN11 gene may trigger
  signaling pathways leading to the development of hematological malignancies, but
  are rarely found in solid tumors. Yet, aberrant SHP2 expression or activation has
  implications in ...
