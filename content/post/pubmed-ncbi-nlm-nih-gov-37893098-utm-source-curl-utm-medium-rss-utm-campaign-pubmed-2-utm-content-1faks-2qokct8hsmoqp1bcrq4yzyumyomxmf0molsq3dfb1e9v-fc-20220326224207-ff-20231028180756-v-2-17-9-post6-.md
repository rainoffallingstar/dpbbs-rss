  of the oral cavity and are often diagnosed when they have already spread to the
  regional lymph nodes. Advanced stages of cancer are characterized by the development
  of distant metastases. Angiogenesis, a hallmark of cancer, is known to contribute
  to cancer progression and metastasis. High microvessel density (MVD) has been linked
