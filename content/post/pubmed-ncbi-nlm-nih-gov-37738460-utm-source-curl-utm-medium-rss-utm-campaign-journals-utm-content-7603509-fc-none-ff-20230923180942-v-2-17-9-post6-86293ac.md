description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with TP53 mutation is one of the most lethal
  cancers and portends an extremely poor prognosis. Based on in silico analyses of
  druggable genes and differential gene expression in TP53 mutated AML, we identified
  polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) as a novel therapeutic target and examined its expression,
  regulation, pathogenetic mechanisms and therapeutic potential in TP53 mutated AML.
  PLK4 expression was suppressed by activated p53 signaling in TP53 wildtype AML and
