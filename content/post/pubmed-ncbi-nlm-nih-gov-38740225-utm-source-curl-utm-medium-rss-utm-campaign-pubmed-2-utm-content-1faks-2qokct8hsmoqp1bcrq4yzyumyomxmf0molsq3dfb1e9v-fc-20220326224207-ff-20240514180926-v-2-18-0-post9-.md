description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a common malignancy with a
  5-year survival <10 %. Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical
  role in the progression of PDA. In recent years, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed
  cell death protein-1 (PD-1) blockade has emerged as a potent anti-tumor immunotherapy,
  while is yet to achieve significant clinical benefits for PDA patients. P21-Activated
  kinase 1 (PAK1) is highly upregulated in PDA and has been reported to ...
