description: Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) could be used to identify individuals at elevated
  risk of cardiac death in lung cancer (LC) screening settings. In a population-based,
  randomized LC screening trial in Germany ("LUSI" study) serum cTnI was measured
  by high-sensitivity assay in blood samples collected at baseline, and categorized
  into unquantifiable/low (< 6 ng/L), intermediate (≥ 6-15 ng/L), and elevated (≥
  16 ng/L). Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate risk of all-cause
  and ...
