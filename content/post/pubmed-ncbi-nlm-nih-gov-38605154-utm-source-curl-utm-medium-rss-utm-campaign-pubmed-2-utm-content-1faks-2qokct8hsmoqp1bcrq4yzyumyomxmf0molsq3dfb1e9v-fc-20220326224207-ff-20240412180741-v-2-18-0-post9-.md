description: Podocyte detachment due to mechanical stress is a common issue in hypertension-induced
  kidney disease. This study highlights the role of zyxin for podocyte stability and
  function. We have found that zyxin is significantly up-regulated in podocytes after
  mechanical stretch and relocalizes from focal adhesions to actin filaments. In zyxin
  knockout podocytes, we found that the loss of zyxin reduced the expression of vinculin
  and VASP as well as the expression of matrix proteins, such ...
