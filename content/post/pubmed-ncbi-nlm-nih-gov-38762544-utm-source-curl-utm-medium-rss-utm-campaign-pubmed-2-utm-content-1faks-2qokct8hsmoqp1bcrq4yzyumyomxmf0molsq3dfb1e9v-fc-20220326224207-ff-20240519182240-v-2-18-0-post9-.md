description: Interactions between genetic perturbations and segregating loci can cause
  perturbations to show different phenotypic effects across genetically distinct individuals.
  To study these interactions on a genome scale in many individuals, we used combinatorial
  DNA barcode sequencing to measure the fitness effects of 8046 CRISPRi perturbations
  targeting 1721 distinct genes in 169 yeast cross progeny (or segregants). We identified
  460 genes whose perturbation has different effects across ...
