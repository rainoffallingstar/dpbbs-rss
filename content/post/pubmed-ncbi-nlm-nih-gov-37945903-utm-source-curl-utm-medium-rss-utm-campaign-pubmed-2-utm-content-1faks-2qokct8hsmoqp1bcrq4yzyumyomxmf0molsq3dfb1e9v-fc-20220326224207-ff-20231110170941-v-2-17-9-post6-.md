description: The transferability and clinical value of genetic risk scores (GRSs)
  across populations remain limited due to an imbalance in genetic studies across
  ancestrally diverse populations. Here we conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide
  association study of 156,319 prostate cancer cases and 788,443 controls of European,
  African, Asian and Hispanic men, reflecting a 57% increase in the number of non-European
  cases over previous prostate cancer genome-wide association studies. We identified
