description: Notch signaling regulates cell-fate decisions in several developmental
  processes and cell functions. However, a role for Notch in hepatic thrombopoietin
  (TPO) production remains unclear. We noted thrombocytopenia in mice with hepatic
  Notch1 deficiency, and so investigated TPO production and other features of platelets
  in these mice. We found that the liver ultrastructure and hepatocyte function were
  comparable between control mice and Notch1-deficient mice. However, the Notch1-deficient
  mice ...
