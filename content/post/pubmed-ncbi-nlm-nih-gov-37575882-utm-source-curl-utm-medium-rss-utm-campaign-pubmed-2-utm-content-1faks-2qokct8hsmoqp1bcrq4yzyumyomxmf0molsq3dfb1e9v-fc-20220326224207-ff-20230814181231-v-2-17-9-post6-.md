description: The Turing mechanism describes the emergence of spatial patterns due
  to spontaneous symmetry breaking in reaction-diffusion processes and underlies many
  developmental processes. Identifying Turing mechanisms in biological systems defines
  a challenging problem. This paper introduces an approach to the prediction of Turing
  parameter values from observed Turing patterns. The parameter values correspond
