description: Protein kinase D (PKD) enzymes play important roles in regulating myocardial
  contraction, hypertrophy, and remodeling. One of the proteins phosphorylated by
  PKD is titin, which is involved in myofilament function. In this study, we aimed
  to investigate the role of PKD in cardiomyocyte function under conditions of oxidative
  stress. To do this, we used mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out of Prkd1,
  which encodes PKD1 (Prkd1^(loxP/loxP); ^(αMHC-Cre); PKD1 cKO), as well as wild ...
