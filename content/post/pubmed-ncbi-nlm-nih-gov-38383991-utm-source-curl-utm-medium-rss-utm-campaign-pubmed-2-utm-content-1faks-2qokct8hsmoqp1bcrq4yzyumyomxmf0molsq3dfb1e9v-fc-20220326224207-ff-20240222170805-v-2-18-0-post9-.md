description: Dicarbonyl compounds are highly reactive precursors of Advanced Glycation
  End-products (AGEs), produced endogenously, present in certain foods, and formed
  during food processing. AGEs contribute to development of adverse metabolic outcomes
  but health effects of dietary dicarbonyls are largely unexplored. We investigated
  associations between three dietary dicarbonyl compounds, methylglyoxal (MGO), glyoxal
  (GO), and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), and body-weight changes in European adults. ...
