description: Viruses that carry a positive-sense, single-stranded (+ssRNA) RNA translate
  their genomes soon after entering the host cell to produce viral proteins, with
  the exception of retroviruses. A distinguishing feature of retroviruses is reverse
  transcription, where the +ssRNA genome serves as a template to synthesize a double-stranded
  DNA copy that subsequently integrates into the host genome. As retroviral RNAs are
  produced by the host cell transcriptional machinery and are largely ...
