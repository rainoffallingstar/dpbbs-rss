description: The neurobiology of tumors has attracted considerable interest from clinicians
  and scientists and has become a multidisciplinary area of research. Neural components
  not only interact with tumor cells but also influence other elements within the
  TME, such as immune cells and vascular components, forming a polygonal relationship
  to synergistically facilitate tumor growth and progression. This review comprehensively
