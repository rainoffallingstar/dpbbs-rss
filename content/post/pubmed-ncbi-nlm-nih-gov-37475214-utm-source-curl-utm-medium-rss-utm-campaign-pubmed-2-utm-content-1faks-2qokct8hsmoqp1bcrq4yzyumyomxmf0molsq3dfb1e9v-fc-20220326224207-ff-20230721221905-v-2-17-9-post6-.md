description: Blood platelets are central elements of the blood clotting response after
  wounding. Upon vessel damage, they bind to the surrounding matrix and contract the
  forming thrombus, thus helping to restore normal blood circulation. The hemostatic
  function of platelets is directly connected to their mechanics and cytoskeletal
  organization. The reorganization of the platelet cytoskeleton during spreading occurs
  within minutes and leads to the formation of contractile actomyosin bundles, but
