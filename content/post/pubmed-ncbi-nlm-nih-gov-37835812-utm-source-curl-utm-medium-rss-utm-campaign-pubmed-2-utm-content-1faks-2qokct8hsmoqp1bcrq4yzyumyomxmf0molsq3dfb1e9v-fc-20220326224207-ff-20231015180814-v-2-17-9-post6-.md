description: The prevalence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing due to advanced
  imaging techniques. Surgical resection is the standard treatment, involving complex
  radical and partial nephrectomy procedures that demand extensive training and planning.
  Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially aid the training process
  in the field of kidney cancer. This review explores how artificial intelligence
  (AI) can create a framework for kidney cancer surgery to address training ...
