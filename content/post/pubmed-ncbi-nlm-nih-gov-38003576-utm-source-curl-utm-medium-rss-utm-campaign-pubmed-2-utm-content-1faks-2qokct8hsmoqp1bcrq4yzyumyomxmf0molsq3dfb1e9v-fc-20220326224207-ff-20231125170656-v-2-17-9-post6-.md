description: The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibition for recurrent and metastatic
  head and neck cancer has brought a new treatment option for patients suffering from
  advanced oral cancers without a chance for curation using surgery or radiotherapy.
  The application of immune checkpoint inhibitors in most cases is based on the expression
  levels of PD-L1 in the tumor tissue. To date, there is a lack of data on the dynamic
  regulation of PD-L1 during disease progression. Therefore, this study aimed ...
