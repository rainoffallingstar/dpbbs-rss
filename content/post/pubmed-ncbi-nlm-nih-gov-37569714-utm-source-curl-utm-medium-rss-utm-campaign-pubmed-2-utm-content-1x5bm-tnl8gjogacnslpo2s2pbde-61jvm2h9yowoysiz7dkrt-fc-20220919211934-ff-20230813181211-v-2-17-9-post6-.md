description: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a movement disorder caused by a dopamine
  deficit in the brain. Current therapies primarily focus on dopamine modulators or
  replacements, such as levodopa. Although dopamine replacement can help alleviate
  PD symptoms, therapies targeting the underlying neurodegenerative process are limited.
  The study objective was to use artificial intelligence to rank the most promising
  repurposed drug candidates for PD. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques
  were used ...
