description: Many of Earth's microbes remain uncultured and under-studied, limiting
  our understanding of the functional and evolutionary aspects of their genetic material,
  which remain largely overlooked in most metagenomic studies¹. Here, we analyzed
  149,842 environmental genomes from multiple habitats^(2-6) and compiled a curated
  catalog of 404,085 functionally and evolutionarily significant novel (FESNov) gene
  families exclusive to uncultivated prokaryotic taxa. All FESNov families span multiple
