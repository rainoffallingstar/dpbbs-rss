description: Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) share numerous features with healthy hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSCs). G-protein coupled receptor family C group 5 member C (GPRC5C)
  is a regulator of HSC dormancy. However, GPRC5C functionality in acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) is yet to be determined. Within patient AML cohorts, high GPRC5C levels correlated
  with poorer survival. Ectopic Gprc5c expression increased AML aggression through
  activation of NF-κB, which resulted in an altered metabolic state with ...
