description: N-terminal processing by methionine aminopeptidases (MetAP) is a crucial
  step in the maturation of proteins during protein biosynthesis. Small molecule inhibitors
  of MetAP2 have anti-angiogenic and antitumoral activity. Herein, we characterize
  the structurally novel MetAP2 inhibitor M8891. M8891 is a potent, selective, reversible
  small molecule inhibitor blocking the growth of human endothelial cells and differentially
  inhibiting cancer cell growth. A CRISPR genome-wide screen identified ...
