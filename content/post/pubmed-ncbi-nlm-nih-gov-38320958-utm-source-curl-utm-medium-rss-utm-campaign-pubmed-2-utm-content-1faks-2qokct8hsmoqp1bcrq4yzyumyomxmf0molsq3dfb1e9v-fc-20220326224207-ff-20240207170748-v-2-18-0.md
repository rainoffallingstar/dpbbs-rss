description: A man in his 60s with a virgin abdomen presented with sudden-onset generalised
  abdominal pain and fevers. The night prior, he snacked on supermarket purchased
  dehydrated apples. CT abdomen and pelvis revealed small bowel obstruction (SBO)
  to the mid ileum and small amount of free fluid within the pelvis. The patient underwent
  emergency exploratory laparotomy. High-grade SBO was identified, caused by large
  obstructing phytobezoars, with three further proximal large phytobezoars identified.
