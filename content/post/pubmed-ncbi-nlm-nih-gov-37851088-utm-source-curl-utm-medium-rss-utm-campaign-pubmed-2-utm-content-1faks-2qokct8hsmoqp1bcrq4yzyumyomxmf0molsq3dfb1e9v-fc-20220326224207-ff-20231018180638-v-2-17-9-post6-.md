description: Due to the low proton density of the lung parenchyma and the rapid signal
  decay at the air-tissue interfaces, for a long time the lungs were difficult to
  access using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however, technical advances could
  address most of these obstacles. Pulmonary alterations associated with tissue proliferation
  ("plus pathologies"), can now be detected with high diagnostic accuracy because
  of the locally increased proton density. Compared to computed tomography (CT), MRI
