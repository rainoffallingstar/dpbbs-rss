description: Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is a subtype of stroke that predominantly
  impacts younger individuals. It is associated with high mortality rates and can
  cause long-term disabilities. This review examines the contribution of the initial
  blood load and the dynamics of clot clearance to the pathophysiology of SAH and
  the risk of adverse outcomes. These outcomes include hydrocephalus and delayed cerebral
  ischaemia (DCI), with a particular focus on the impact of blood located in the cisternal
