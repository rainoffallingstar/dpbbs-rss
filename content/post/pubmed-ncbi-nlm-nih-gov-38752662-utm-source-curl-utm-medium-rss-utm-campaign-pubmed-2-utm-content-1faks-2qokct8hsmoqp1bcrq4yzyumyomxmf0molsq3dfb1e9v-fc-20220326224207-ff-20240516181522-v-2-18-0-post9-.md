description: Bioimage data are generated in diverse research fields throughout the
  life and biomedical sciences. Its potential for advancing scientific progress via
  modern, data-driven discovery approaches reaches beyond disciplinary borders. To
  fully exploit this potential, it is necessary to make bioimaging data, in general,
  multidimensional microscopy images and image series, FAIR, that is, findable, accessible,
  interoperable and reusable. These FAIR principles for research data management are
