description: Platelet α-granules are rich in TGF-β1 which is associated with myeloid-derived
  suppressor cell (MDSC) biology. Responders to thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs)
  revealed a parallel increase in the number of both platelets and MDSCs. Here, anti-CD61
  immune-sensitized splenocytes were transferred into severe combined immunodeficient
  mice to establish an active murine model of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Subsequently,
  we demonstrated that TPO-RAs augmented the inhibitory activities ...
