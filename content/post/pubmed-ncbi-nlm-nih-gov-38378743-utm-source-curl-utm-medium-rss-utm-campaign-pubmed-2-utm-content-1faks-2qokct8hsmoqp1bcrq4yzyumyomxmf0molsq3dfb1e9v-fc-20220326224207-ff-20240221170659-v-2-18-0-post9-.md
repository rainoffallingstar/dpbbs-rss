description: Autophagy-related genes have been closely associated with intestinal
  homeostasis. BECLIN1 is a component of Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes
  that orchestrate autophagy initiation and endocytic trafficking. Here we show intestinal
  epithelium-specific BECLIN1 deletion in adult mice leads to rapid fatal enteritis
  with compromised gut barrier integrity, highlighting its intrinsic critical role
  in gut maintenance. BECLIN1-deficient intestinal epithelial cells exhibit ...
