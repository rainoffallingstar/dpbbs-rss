description: Coagulation Factor VIII (FVIII) and its carrier protein von Willebrand
  factor (VWF) are critical to coagulation and platelet aggregation. We leveraged
  whole genome sequence data from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)
  program along with TOPMed-based imputation of genotypes in additional samples to
  identify genetic associations with circulating FVIII and VWF levels in a single
  variant meta-analysis including up to 45,289 participants. Gene-based aggregate
  tests were implemented ...
