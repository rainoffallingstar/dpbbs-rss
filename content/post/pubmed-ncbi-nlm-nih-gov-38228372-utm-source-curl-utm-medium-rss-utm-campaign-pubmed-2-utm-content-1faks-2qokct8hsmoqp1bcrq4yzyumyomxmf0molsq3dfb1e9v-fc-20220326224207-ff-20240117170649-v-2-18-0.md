description: Tumor cells subvert immune surveillance or lytic stress by harnessing
  inhibitory signals. Hence, bispecific antibodies have been developed to direct CTLs
  to the tumor site and foster immune-dependent cytotoxicity. Although applied with
  success, T cell-based immunotherapies are not universally effective partially because
  of the expression of pro-survival factors by tumor cells protecting them from apoptosis.
  Here, we report a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in human non-small cell lung cancer cells ...
