description: Octadentate and specifically nonadentate ligands with a bispidine scaffold
  (3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) are known to be efficiently coordinated to a range
  of metal ions of interest in radiopharmaceutical chemistry and lead to exceedingly
  stable and inert complexes. Nonadentate bispidine L^(2) (with a tridentate bipyridine
  acetate appended to N3 and a picolinate at N7) has been shown before to be an ideal
  chelator for ^(111)In^(3+), ^(177)Lu^(3+), and ^(225)Ac^(3+), nuclides of interest
