description: CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy with brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel)
  has substantially improved treatment outcomes for patients with relapsed/refractory
  mantle cell lymphoma (r/r MCL). Prolonged cytopenias and infections represent common
  and clinically relevant side effects. In this multicenter observational study, we
  describe cytopenias and infections in 103 r/r MCL patients receiving brexu-cel.
  Furthermore, we report associations between the baseline CAR-HEMATOTOX (HT) score
