description: GATA2 deficiency is a heterogeneous, multisystem disorder associated
  with a high risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and the progression
  to acute myeloid leukemia. The mechanisms underlying malignant transformation in
  GATA2 deficiency remain poorly understood, necessitating predictive markers to assess
