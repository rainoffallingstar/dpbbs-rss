description: Cancer immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells can
  cause immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). However, the
  molecular mechanisms leading to ICANS are not well understood. Here we examined
  the role of microglia using mouse models and cohorts of individuals with ICANS.
  CD19-directed CAR (CAR19) T cell transfer in B cell lymphoma-bearing mice caused
  microglia activation and neurocognitive deficits. The TGFβ-activated kinase-1 (TAK1)-NF-κB-p38
