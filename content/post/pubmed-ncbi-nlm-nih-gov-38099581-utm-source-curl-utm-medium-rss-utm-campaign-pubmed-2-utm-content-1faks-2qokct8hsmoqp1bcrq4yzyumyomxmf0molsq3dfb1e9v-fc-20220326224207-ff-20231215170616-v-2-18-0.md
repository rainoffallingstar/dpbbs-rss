description: The visual system has evolved the ability to track features like color
  and orientation in parallel. This property aligns with the specialization of processing
  these feature dimensions in the visual cortex. But what if we ask to track changing
  feature-values within the same feature dimension? Parallel tracking would then have
  to share the same cortical representation, which would set strong limitations on
  tracking performance. We address this question by measuring the precision of ...
