description: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells directed against CD19 (CAR19)
  are a revolutionary treatment for B-cell lymphomas. CAR19 cell expansion is necessary
  for CAR19 function but is also associated with toxicity. To define the impact of
  CAR19 expansion on patient outcomes, we prospectively followed a cohort of 236 patients
  treated with CAR19 (brexucabtagene autoleucel or axicabtagene ciloleucel) for mantle
  cell (MCL), follicular (FL), and large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) over the course of
