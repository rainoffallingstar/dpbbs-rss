description: Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are amphipathic lipid molecules derived from
  phosphatidylinositol (PI) that represent low abundance components of biological
  membranes. Rather than serving as mere structural elements of lipid bilayers, they
  represent molecular switches for a broad range of biological processes, including
  cell signaling, membrane dynamics and remodeling, and many other functions. Here,
  we focus on the molecular mechanisms that turn phosphoinositides into molecular
  switches and how ...
