description: Peripheral nerve lesions of the upper extremity are common and are associated
  with devastating limitations for the patient. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of the
  lesion by electroneurography, neurosonography, or even MR neurography is important
  for treatment planning. There are different therapeutic approaches, which may show
  individual differences depending on the injured nerve. If a primary nerve repair
  is not possible, several strategies exist to bridge the gap. These may include ...
