description: Tumor microtubes (TMs) connect glioma cells to a network with considerable
  relevance for tumor progression and therapy resistance. However, the determination
  of TM-interconnectivity in individual tumors is challenging and the impact on patient
  survival unresolved. Here, we establish a connectivity signature from single-cell
  RNA-sequenced (scRNA-Seq) xenografted primary glioblastoma (GB) cells using a dye
  uptake methodology, and validate it with recording of cellular calcium epochs and
