description: This review article describes the pathophysiological mechanisms linking
  Apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) and atherosclerosis, summarizes the existing evidence on
  Apo B as a predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and recommendations
  of (inter)national treatment guidelines regarding Apo B in dyslipidemia management.
  A single Apo B molecule is present in every particle of very low-density lipoprotein,
  intermediate density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and lipoprotein(a). This
