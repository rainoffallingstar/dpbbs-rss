description: This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of The International
  System (TIS) for reporting serous fluid cytopathology. Our aims were to present
  the pooled malignancy rate of each TIS reporting category and the diagnostic accuracy
  of cytology using this system. Database search using a predefined strategy was followed
  by study selection, data extraction, study quality assessment, and statistical analysis.
  Data derived from 16 eligible studies were pooled. The pooled rates of ...
