description: 6-Pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase (6-PTPS) is a lyase involved in
  the synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin. In Plasmodium species where dihydroneopterin
  aldolase (DHNA) is absent, it acts in the folate biosynthetic pathway necessary
  for the growth and survival of the parasite. The 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin synthase
  of Plasmodium falciparum (PfPTPS) has been identified as a potential antimalarial
  drug target. This study identified potential inhibitors of PfPTPS using molecular
