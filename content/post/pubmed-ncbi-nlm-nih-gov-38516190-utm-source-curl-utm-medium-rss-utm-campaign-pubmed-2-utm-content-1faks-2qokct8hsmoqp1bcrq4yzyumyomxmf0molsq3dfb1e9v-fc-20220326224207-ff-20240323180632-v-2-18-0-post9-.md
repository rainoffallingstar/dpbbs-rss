description: Proteasome degradation is an integral part of cellular growth and function.
  Proteasomal intervention may mitigate adverse myocardial remodeling, but is associated
  with the onset of heart failure. Previously, we have demonstrated that increasing
  abundance of cardiac Lmp2 and its incorporation into proteasome complexes is an
  endogenous mechanism for proteasome regulation during hypertrophic remodeling of
  the heart induced by chronic ß-adrenoreceptor stimulation. Here, we investigated
  whether ...
