description: Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (Usp22) cleaves ubiquitin moieties from
  numerous proteins, including histone H2B and transcription factors. Recently, it
  was reported that Usp22 acts as a negative regulator of interferon-dependent responses.
  In the current study, we investigated the role of Usp22 deficiency in acute viral
  infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). We found that the lack
  of Usp22 on bone marrow-derived cells (Usp22^(fl/fl) Vav1-Cre mice) reduced the
