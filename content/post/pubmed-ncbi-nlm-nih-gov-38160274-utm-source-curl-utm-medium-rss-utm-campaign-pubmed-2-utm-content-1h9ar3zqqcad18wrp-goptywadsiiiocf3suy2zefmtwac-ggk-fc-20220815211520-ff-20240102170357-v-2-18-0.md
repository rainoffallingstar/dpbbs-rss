  for medical and public health research. Previous work is limited to develop specialized
  rule-based or customized supervised learning models to predict diagnosis coding,
  which is tedious and not easily transferable. In this work, we show that open-source
  large language models (LLMs) pretrained on general corpus can achieve reasonable
  performance in a zero-shot setting. Alpaca-7B can achieve a zero-shot F1 of 0.538
