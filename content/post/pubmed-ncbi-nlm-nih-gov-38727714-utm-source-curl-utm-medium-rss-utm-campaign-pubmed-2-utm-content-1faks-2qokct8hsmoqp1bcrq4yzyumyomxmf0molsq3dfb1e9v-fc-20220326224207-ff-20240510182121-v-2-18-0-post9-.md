description: Neuropeptides are ancient signaling molecules in animals but only few
  peptide receptors are known outside bilaterians. Cnidarians possess a large number
  of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) - the most common receptors of bilaterian
  neuropeptides - but most of these remain orphan with no known ligands. We searched
  for neuropeptides in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and created a library
  of 64 peptides derived from 33 precursors. In a large-scale pharmacological screen
