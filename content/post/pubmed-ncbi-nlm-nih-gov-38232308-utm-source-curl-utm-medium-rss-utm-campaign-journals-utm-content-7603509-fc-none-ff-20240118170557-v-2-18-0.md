description: As a functional component of erythrocyte hemoglobin, iron is essential
  for oxygen delivery to all tissues in the body. The liver-derived peptide hepcidin
  is the master regulator of iron homeostasis. During anemia, the erythroid hormone
  erythroferrone regulates hepcidin synthesis to ensure the adequate supply of iron
  to the bone marrow for red blood cells production. However, mounting evidence suggested
  that another factor may exert a similar function. We identified the hepatokine FGL1
