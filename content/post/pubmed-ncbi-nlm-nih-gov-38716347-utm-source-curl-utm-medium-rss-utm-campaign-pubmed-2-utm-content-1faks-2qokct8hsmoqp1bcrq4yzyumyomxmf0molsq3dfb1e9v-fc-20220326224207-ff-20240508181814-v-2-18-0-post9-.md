description: L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-HGA) is a rare neurometabolic disorder
  characterized by accumulation of L2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2-HG) due to mutations in
  the L2HGDH gene. L-2-HGA patients have a significantly increased lifetime risk of
  central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Here, we present a 16-year-old girl with L-2-HGA
  who developed a tumor in the right cerebral hemisphere, which was discovered after
  left-sided neurological deficits of the patient. Histologically, the tumor had a
