description: Due to the dependency structure in the sampling process, adaptive trial
  designs create challenges in point and interval estimation and in the calculation
  of P-values. Optimal adaptive designs, which are designs where the parameters governing
  the adaptivity are chosen to maximize some performance criterion, suffer from the
  same problem. Various analysis methods which are able to handle this dependency
  structure have already been developed. In this work, we aim to give a comprehensive
