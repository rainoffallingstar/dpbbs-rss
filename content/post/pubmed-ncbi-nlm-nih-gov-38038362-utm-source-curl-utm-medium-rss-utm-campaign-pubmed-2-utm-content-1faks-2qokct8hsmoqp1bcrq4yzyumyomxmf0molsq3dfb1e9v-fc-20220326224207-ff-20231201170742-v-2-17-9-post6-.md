description: Despite the overwhelming evidence that multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune
  disease, relatively little is known about the precise nature of the immune dysregulation
  underlying the development of the disease. Reasoning that the cerebrospinal fluid
  from patients might be enriched for cells relevant in pathogenesis, we have completed
  a high-resolution single-cell analysis of 96,732 cerebrospinal fluid cells collected
  from 33 patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 48,675) and 48 patients with ...
