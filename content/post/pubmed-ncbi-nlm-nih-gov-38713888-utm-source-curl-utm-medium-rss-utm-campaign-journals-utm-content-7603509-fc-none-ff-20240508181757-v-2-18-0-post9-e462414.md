description: Mass spectrometry (MS) can detect multiple myeloma-derived monoclonal
  proteins in peripheral blood (PB) with high sensitivity, potentially serving as
  a PB assay for measurable residual disease (MRD). This study evaluated the significance
  of PB MS MRD negativity during post-transplant therapy in patients with newly diagnosed
  multiple myeloma. Serum samples from 138 patients treated in the phase 3 ATLAS trial
  of post-transplant maintenance with either carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone
