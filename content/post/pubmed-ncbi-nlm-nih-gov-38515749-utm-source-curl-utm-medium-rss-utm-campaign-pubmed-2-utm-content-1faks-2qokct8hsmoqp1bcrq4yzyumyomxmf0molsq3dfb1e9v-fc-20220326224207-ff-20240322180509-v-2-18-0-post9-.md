description: The innate immune response represents the first-line of defense against
  invading pathogens. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species
  (RNS) have been implicated in various aspects of innate immune function, which involves
  respiratory bursts and inflammasome activation. These reactive species widely distributed
  within the cellular environment are short-lived intermediates that play a vital
  role in cellular signaling and proliferation and are likely to depend on their ...
