  strength athletes in comparison with sedentary subjects under controlled conditions
  and about variation of the metabolome throughout one year. We hypothesized that
  (1) the resting metabolic profile differs between sedentary subjects and athletes
  and between perennially endurance- and strength-trained athletes and (2) varies
  throughout one year of training. We performed quantitative, targeted metabolomics
