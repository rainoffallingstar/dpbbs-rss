description: Identifying cancer genes is vital for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
  However, because of the complexity of cancer occurrence and limited cancer genes
  knowledge, it is hard to identify cancer genes accurately using only a few omics
  data, and the overall performance of existing methods is being called for further
  improvement. Here, we introduce a two-stage gradual-learning strategy GLIMS to predict
  cancer genes using integrative features from multi-omics data. Firstly, it uses
