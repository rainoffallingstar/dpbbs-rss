description: We report the observation and control of ultrafast many-body dynamics
  of electrons in ultracold Rydberg-excited atoms, spatially ordered in a three-dimensional
  Mott insulator (MI) with unity filling in an optical lattice. By mapping out the
  time-domain Ramsey interferometry in the picosecond timescale, we can deduce entanglement
  growth indicating the emergence of many-body correlations via dipolar forces. We
  analyze our observations with different theoretical approaches and find that ...
