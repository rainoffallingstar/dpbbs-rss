description: The arteriovenous loop (AVL) model allows the in vivo engineering of
  axially vascularized flaps, the so called AVL flaps. Although AVL flaps can be transplanted
  microsurgically to cover tissue defects, they lack an epithelial layer on the surface.
  Therefore, the objective of this study was to engineer axially vascularized AVL
  flaps with an accompanying epithelial layer for local defect reconstruction. In
  this study AVLs were established in 20 male Lewis rats. Minimally invasive injection
