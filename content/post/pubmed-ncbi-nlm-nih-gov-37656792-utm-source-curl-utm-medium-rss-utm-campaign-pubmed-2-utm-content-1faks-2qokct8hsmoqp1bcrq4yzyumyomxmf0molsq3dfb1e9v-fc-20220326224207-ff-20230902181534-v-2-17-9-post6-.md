description: Hybrid perovskite semiconductor materials are predicted to lock chirality
  into place and encode asymmetry into their electronic states, while softness of
  their crystal lattice accommodates lattice strain to maintain high crystal quality
  with low defect densities, necessary for high luminescence yields. We report photoluminescence
  quantum efficiencies as high as 39% and degrees of circularly polarized photoluminescence
  of up to 52%, at room temperature, in the chiral layered hybrid ...
