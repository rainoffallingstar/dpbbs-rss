  via electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. As the spread of electric current
  in biological tissues is rather broad, the spectral information provided by electrical
  CIs is limited. Optogenetic stimulation of the auditory nerve has been suggested
  for artificial sound coding with improved spectral selectivity, as light can be
  conveniently confined in space. Yet, the foundations for optogenetic sound coding
