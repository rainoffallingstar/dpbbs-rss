description: We report a synthetic approach to p-expanded [6]helicenes incorporating
  tropone and azocine units in combination with a 5-membered ring, which exhibit intriguing
  structural, electronic, and chiroptical properties. The regioselective Beckmann
  rearrangement allows the isolation of helical scaffolds containing 8-membered lactam,
  azocine, and amine units. As shown by X-ray crystallographic analysis, the incorporation
  of tropone or azocine units leads to highly distorted [6]helicene moieties, ...
