description: Skin-resident CD8^(+) T cells include distinct interferon-γ-producing
  [tissue-resident memory T type 1 (T(RM)1)] and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing
  (T(RM)17) subsets that differentially contribute to immune responses. However, whether
  these populations use common mechanisms to establish tissue residence is unknown.
  In this work, we show that T(RM)1 and T(RM)17 cells navigate divergent trajectories
  to acquire tissue residency in the skin. T(RM)1 cells depend on a T-bet-Hobit-IL-15
  axis, ...
