description: Tissue-resident memory T cells (T(RM) cells) have become an interesting
  subject of study for antitumor immunity in melanoma and other solid tumors. In the
  initial phases of antitumor immunity, they maintain an immune equilibrium and protect

  (ICI) because they highly express inhibitory checkpoint molecules such as ...
