description: Exocytosis and endocytosis are essential physiological processes and
  are of prime importance for brain function. Neurotransmission depends on the Ca^(2+)-triggered
  exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs). In neurons, exocytosis is spatiotemporally
  coupled to the retrieval of an equal amount of membrane and SV proteins by compensatory
  endocytosis. How exocytosis and endocytosis are balanced to maintain presynaptic
  membrane homeostasis and, thereby, sustain brain function is essentially unknown.
