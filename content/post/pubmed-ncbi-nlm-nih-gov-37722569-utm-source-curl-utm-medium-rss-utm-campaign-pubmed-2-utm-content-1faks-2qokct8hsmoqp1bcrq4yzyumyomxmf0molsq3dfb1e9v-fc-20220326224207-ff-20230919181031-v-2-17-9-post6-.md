description: Synaptic signaling depends on ATP generated by mitochondria. Dysfunctional
  mitochondria shift the redox balance towards a more oxidative environment. Due to
  extensive connectivity, the striatum is especially vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction.
  We found that neuronal calcium-binding protein 2 (NECAB2) plays a role in striatal
  function and mitochondrial homeostasis. NECAB2 is a predominantly endosomal striatal
  protein which partially colocalizes with mitochondria. This colocalization ...
