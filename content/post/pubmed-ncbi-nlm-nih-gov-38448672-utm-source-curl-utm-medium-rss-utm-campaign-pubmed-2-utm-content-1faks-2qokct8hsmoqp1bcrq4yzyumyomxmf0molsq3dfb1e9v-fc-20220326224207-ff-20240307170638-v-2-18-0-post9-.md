description: MAGEA4 is a cancer-testis antigen primarily expressed in the testes but
  aberrantly overexpressed in several cancers. MAGEA4 interacts with the RING ubiquitin
  ligase RAD18 and activates trans-lesion DNA synthesis (TLS), potentially favouring
  tumour evolution. Here, we employed NMR and AlphaFold2 (AF) to elucidate the interaction
  mode between RAD18 and MAGEA4, and reveal that the RAD6-binding domain (R6BD) of
  RAD18 occupies a groove in the C-terminal winged-helix subdomain of MAGEA4. We found
