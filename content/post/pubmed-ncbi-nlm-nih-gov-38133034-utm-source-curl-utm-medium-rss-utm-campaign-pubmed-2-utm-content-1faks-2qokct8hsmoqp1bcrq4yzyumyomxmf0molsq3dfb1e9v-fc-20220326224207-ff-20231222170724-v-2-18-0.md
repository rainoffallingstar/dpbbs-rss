description: The effective detection of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in different
  environments and, above all, in biological media, is an important practical issue.
  To this end, we designed a novel electrochemical sensor for H(2)O(2) detection by
  introducing gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into the porous poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
  matrix formed by the thermally activated crosslinking of amino- and epoxy-decorated
  STAR-PEG precursors. The respective composite PEG-AuNP films could be readily prepared
  on ...
