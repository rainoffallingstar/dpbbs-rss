description: We search for tri-nucleon decays of 76Ge in the dataset from the GERmanium
  Detector Array (GERDA) experiment. Decays that populate excited levels of the daughter
  nucleus above the threshold for particle emission lead to disintegration and are
  not considered. The ppp-, ppn-, and pnn-decays lead to 73Cu, 73Zn, and 73Ga nuclei,
  respectively. These nuclei are unstable and eventually proceed by the beta decay
  of 73Ga to 73Ge (stable). We search for the 73Ga decay exploiting the fact that
