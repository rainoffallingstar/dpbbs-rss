description: 'CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this cohort study highlights the association
  of hypoalbuminemia with adverse postoperative outcomes, including those not directly
  related to frailty. Simultaneously, higher mFI scores independently predicted outcomes
  not associated with hypoalbuminemia. Stemming from these findings, we recommend
  considering both serum albumin levels and frailty in patients receiving FFR. This
  perioperative algorithm may help provide more individualized planning ...'
