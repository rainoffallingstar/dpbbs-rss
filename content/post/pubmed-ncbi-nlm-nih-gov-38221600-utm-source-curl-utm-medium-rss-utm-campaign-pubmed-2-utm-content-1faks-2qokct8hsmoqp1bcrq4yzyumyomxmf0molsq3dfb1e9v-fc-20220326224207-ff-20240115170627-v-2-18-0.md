CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic zirconia CFPDs might be a viable alternative to completely veneered CoCr CFPDs in terms of fracture load. However, oblique loading of monolithic zirconia CFPDs should be avoided in clinical scenarios. Design improvements are required for partially veneered zirconia CFPDs to enhance their load-bearing ...
