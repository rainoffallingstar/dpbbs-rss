CONCLUSIONS: We performed the first double-stratified GWAS of PCSK9 levels and identified multiple biologically plausible loci with genetic interaction effects. Our results indicate that the observed sexual dimorphism of PCSK9 and its statin-related interactions have a genetic basis. Significant differences in the causal relationship between PCSK9 and LDL-C suggest sex-specific dosages of PCSK9 ...
