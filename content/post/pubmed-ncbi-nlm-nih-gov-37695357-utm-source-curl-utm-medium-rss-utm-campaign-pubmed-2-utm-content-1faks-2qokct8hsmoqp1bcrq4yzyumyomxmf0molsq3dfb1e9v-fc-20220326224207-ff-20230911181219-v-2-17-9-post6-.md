description: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant
  vascular disorder characterized by small, dilated clustered vessels (telangiectasias)
  and by larger visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which directly connect
  the feeding arteries with the draining veins. These lesions are fragile, prone to
  rupture, and lead to recurrent epistaxis and/or internal hemorrhage among other
  complications. Germline heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in Bone Morphogenic
