description: Plasma cell disorders are clonal outgrowths of pre-malignant or malignant
  plasma cells, characterized by extensive chromosomal aberrations. Centrosome abnormalities
  are a major driver of chromosomal instability in cancer but their origin, incidence,
  and composition in primary tumor cells is poorly understood. Using cutting-edge,
  semi-automated high-throughput electron tomography, we characterized at nanoscale
  1386 centrioles in CD138^(pos) plasma cells from eight healthy donors and 21 ...
