description: The development process of medical devices can be streamlined by combining
  different study phases. Here, for a diagnostic medical device, we present the combination
  of confirmation of diagnostic accuracy (phase III) and evaluation of clinical effectiveness
  regarding patient-relevant endpoints (phase IV) using a seamless design. This approach
  is used in the Thyroid HEmorrhage DetectOr Study (HEDOS & HEDOS II) investigating
  a post-operative hemorrhage detector named ISAR-M THYRO® in patients ...
