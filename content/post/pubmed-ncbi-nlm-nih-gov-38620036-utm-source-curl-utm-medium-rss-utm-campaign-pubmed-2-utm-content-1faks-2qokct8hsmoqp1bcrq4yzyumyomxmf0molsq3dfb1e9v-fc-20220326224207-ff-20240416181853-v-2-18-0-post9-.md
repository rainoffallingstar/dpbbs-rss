description: Viruses target mitochondria to promote their replication, and infection-induced
  stress during the progression of infection leads to the regulation of antiviral
  defenses and mitochondrial metabolism which are opposed by counteracting viral factors.
  The precise structural and functional changes that underlie how mitochondria react
  to the infection remain largely unclear. Here we show extensive transcriptional
  remodeling of protein-encoding host genes involved in the respiratory chain, ...
