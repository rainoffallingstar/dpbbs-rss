description: Effective T cell responses not only require the engagement of T cell
  receptors (TCRs, "signal 1"), but also the availability of costimulatory signals
  ("signal 2"). T cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) deliver a robust signal 1 by engaging
  the TCR signaling component CD3ε, while simultaneously binding to tumor antigens.
  The CD20-TCB glofitamab redirects T cells to CD20-expressing malignant B cells.
  While glofitamab exhibits strong single agent efficacy, adding costimulatory signaling
  may ...
