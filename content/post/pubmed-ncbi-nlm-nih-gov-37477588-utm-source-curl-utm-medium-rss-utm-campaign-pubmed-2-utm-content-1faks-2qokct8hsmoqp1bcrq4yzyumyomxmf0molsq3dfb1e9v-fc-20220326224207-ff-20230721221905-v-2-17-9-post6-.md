description: Patients with haematological malignancies who survive the first year
  after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) without relapse have a substantial
  risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM), and predictive markers are missing. The Endothelial
  Activation and Stress Index (EASIX) predicts endothelial complications and NRM early
  after alloSCT. We hypothesised that EASIX assessed 1 year after alloSCT in disease-free
  survivors may predict late NRM. Relapse-free survivors at one year after ...
