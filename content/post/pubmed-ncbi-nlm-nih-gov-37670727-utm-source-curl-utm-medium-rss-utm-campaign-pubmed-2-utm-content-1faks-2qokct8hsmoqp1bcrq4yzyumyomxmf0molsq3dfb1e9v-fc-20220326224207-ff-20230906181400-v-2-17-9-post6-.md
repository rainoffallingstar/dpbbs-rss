description: Coding sequence variants comprise a small fraction of the germline genetic
  variability of the human genome. However, they often cause deleterious change in
  protein function and are therefore associated with pathogenic phenotypes. To identify
  novel pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) risk loci, we carried out a complete
  scan of all common missense and synonymous SNPs and analysed them in a case control
  study comprising four different populations, for a total of 14,538 PDAC cases and
