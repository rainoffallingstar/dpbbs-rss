description: The SLC3A2 gene encodes for a cell-surface transmembrane protein CD98hc
  (4F2). CD98hc serves as a chaperone for LAT1 (SLC7A5), LAT2 (SLC7A8), y^(+)LAT1
  (SLC7A7), y^(+)LAT2 (SLC7A6), xCT (SLC7A11) and Asc1 (SLC7A10) providing their recruitment
  to the plasma membrane. Together with the light subunits, it constitutes heterodimeric
  transmembrane amino acid transporters. CD98hc interacts with other surface molecules,
  such as extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer CD147 (EMMPRIN) and ...
