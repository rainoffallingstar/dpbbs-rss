description: Exercise capacity (EC) is an important predictor of survival in the general
  population as well as in individuals with cardiopulmonary disease. Despite its relevance,
  considering percent-predicted workload (%pWL) given by current equations may overestimate
  EC in older adults. Therefore, to improve the reporting of EC in clinical practice,
  our main objective was to develop workload reference equations (pWL) that better
  reflect the relation between workload and age. Using the Fitness Registry ...
