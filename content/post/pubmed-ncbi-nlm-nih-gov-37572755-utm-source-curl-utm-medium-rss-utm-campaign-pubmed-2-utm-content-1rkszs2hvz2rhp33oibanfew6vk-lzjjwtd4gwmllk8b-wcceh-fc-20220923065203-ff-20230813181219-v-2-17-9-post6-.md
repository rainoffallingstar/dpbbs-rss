description: Physiologic levels of basal serum tryptase vary among healthy individuals,
  depending on the numbers of mast cells, basal secretion rate, copy numbers of the
  TPSAB1 gene encoding alpha tryptase, and renal function. Recently, there has been
  a growing debate about the normal range of tryptase because individuals with the
  hereditary alpha tryptasemia (HαT) trait may or may not be symptomatic, and if symptomatic,
  uncertainty exists as to whether this trait directly causes clinical phenotypes
