  (MLKL) is a hallmark of necroptosis, leading to membrane rupture and inflammatory
  cell death. Pro-death functions of MLKL are tightly controlled by several checkpoints,
  including phosphorylation. Endo- and exocytosis limit MLKL membrane accumulation
  and counteract necroptosis, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here,
  we identify linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)-mediated ...
