description: Converging evidence suggests that schizophrenia (SZ) with primary, enduring
  negative symptoms (i.e., Deficit SZ (DSZ)) represents a distinct entity within the
  SZ spectrum while the neurobiological underpinnings remain undetermined. In the
  largest dataset of DSZ and Non-Deficit (NDSZ), we conducted a meta-analysis of data
  from 1560 individuals (168 DSZ, 373 NDSZ, 1019 Healthy Controls (HC)) and a mega-analysis
  of a subsampled data from 944 individuals (115 DSZ, 254 NDSZ, 575 HC) collected
