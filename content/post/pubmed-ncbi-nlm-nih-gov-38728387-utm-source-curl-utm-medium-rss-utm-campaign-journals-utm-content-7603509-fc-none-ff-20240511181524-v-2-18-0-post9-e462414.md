description: It is unclear whether risk of infection is increased in individuals with
  hereditary haemochromatosis and in individuals with low or high plasma iron, transferrin
  saturation, or ferritin. Therefore, we tested whether high and low iron, transferrin
  saturation, and ferritin are associated with risk of infections observationally
  and genetically through HFE genotypes. We studied 142,188 Danish general population
  individuals. Iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin were measured in ...
