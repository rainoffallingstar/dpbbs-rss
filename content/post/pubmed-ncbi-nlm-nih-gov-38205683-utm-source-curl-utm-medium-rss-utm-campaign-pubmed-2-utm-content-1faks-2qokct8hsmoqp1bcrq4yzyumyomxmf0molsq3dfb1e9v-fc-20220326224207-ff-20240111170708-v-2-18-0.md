description: Based on DNA-methylation, ependymomas growing in the spinal cord comprise
  two major molecular types termed spinal (SP-EPN) and myxopapillary ependymomas (MPE(-A/B)),
  which differ with respect to their clinical features and prognosis. Due to the existing
  discrepancy between histomorphogical diagnoses and classification using methylation
  data, we asked whether deep neural networks can predict the DNA methylation class
  of spinal cord ependymomas from hematoxylin and eosin stained ...
