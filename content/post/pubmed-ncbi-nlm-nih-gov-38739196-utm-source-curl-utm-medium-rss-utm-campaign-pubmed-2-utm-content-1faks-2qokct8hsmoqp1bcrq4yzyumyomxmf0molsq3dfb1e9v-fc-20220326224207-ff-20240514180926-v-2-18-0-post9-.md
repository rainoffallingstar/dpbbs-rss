description: The orthoplastic approach involves the collaboration of orthopedic/trauma
  surgeons, vascular surgeons and reconstructive microsurgeons. In cases of complex
  limb fractures, the aims are to optimize blood flow, restore bone stability, reconstruct
  soft tissue defects, and enhance function and sensitivity. The early administration
  of antibiotics and a timely, high-quality debridement after initial interdisciplinary
  assessment are carried out. This is followed by fracture stabilization and ...
