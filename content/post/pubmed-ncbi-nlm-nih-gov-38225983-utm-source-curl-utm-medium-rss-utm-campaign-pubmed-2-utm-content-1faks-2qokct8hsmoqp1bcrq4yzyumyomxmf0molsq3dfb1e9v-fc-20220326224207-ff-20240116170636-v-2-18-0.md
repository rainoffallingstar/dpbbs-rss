description: 'CONCLUSION: The novel method of hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch can
  identify patients suitable for thrombolysis with higher sensitivity and lower specificity
  than established techniques. Using this simple method might therefore increase the
  proportion of patients treated with thrombolysis without the use of special automated
  software.The MissPerfeCT study is a retrospective observational multicenter cohort
  study and is registered with clinicaltrials.gov ...'
