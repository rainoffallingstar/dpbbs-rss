description: Leukemia is a class of hematologic malignancies, of which acute myeloid
  leukemia (AML) is the most common. Screening and diagnosis of AML are performed
  by microscopic examination or chemical testing of images of the patient's peripheral
  blood smear. In smear-microscopy, the ability to quickly identify, count, and differentiate
  different types of blood cells is critical for disease diagnosis. With the development
  of deep learning (DL), classification techniques based on neural networks have ...
