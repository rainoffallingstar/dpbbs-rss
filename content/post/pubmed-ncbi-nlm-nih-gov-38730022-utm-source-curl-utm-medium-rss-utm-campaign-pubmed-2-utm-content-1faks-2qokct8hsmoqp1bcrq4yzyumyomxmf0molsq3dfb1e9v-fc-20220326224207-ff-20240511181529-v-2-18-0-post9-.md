description: In this narrative review, we summarize the current knowledge and applications
  of somatic near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), with a focus on intestinal, renal,
  limb, and multi-site applications in neonates. Assessing somatic oxygenation at
  various body locations in neonates may aid in the understanding of underlying pathophysiology
  of organ injury. Considering cerebral autoregulation may be active to protect the
  brain during systemic circulatory failure, peripheral somatic oxygenation ...
