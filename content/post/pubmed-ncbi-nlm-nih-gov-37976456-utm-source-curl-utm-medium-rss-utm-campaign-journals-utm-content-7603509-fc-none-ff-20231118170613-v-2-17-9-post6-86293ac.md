description: CD19 CAR T-cells and CD20 targeting T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies
  have been approved in B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma lately, heralding a new clinical
  setting where patients are treated with both approaches, sequentially. The aim of
  our study was to investigate the selective pressure of CD19 and CD20 directed therapy
  on the clonal architecture in lymphoma. Using a broad analytical pipeline on 28
  longitudinally collected specimen from seven patients, we identified truncating
  mutations ...
