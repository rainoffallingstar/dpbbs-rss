description: CRISPR-Cas9 is a programmable gene editing tool with a promising potential
  for cancer gene therapy. This therapeutic function is enabled in the present work
  via the non-covalent delivery of CRISPR ribonucleic protein (RNP) by cationic glucosamine/PEI-derived
  graphene quantum dots (PEI-GQD) that aid in overcoming physiological barriers and
  tracking genes of interest. PEI-GQD/RNP complex targeting the TP53 mutation overexpressed
  in ~50% of cancers successfully produces its double-stranded ...
