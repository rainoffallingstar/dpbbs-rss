description: Ginseng, a valuable Chinese medicinal herb, is renowned worldwide for
  its effectiveness in alleviating certain conditions and promoting overall health.
  In this study, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)
  on the accumulation of essential saponins under the influence of 13 essential environmental
  factors (including air temperature, air bottom temperature, surface mean temperature,
  soil temperature, surface shortwave radiation, soil moisture, soil water ...
