description: Hormone-activated proteolysis is a recurring theme of plant hormone signaling
  mechanisms. In strigolactone signaling, the enzyme-receptor DWARF14 (D14) and an
  F-box protein, MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2), mark SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE (SMXL)
  family proteins SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8 for rapid degradation. Removal of these
  transcriptional corepressors initiates downstream growth responses. The homologous
  proteins SMXL3, SMXL4, and SMXL5, however, are resistant to MAX2-mediated degradation.
