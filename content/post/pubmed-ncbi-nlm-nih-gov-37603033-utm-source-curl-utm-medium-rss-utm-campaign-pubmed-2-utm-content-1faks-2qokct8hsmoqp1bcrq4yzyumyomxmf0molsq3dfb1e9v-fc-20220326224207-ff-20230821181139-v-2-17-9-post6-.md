description: Analytical and therapeutic innovations led to a continuous but variable
  extension of newborn screening (NBS) programs worldwide. Every extension requires
  a careful evaluation of feasibility, diagnostic (process) quality, and possible
  health benefits to balance benefits and limitations. The aim of this study was to
  evaluate the suitability of 18 candidate diseases for inclusion in NBS programs.
