description: D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) accumulates in primary acute myeloid leukemia
  (AML) patients with mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and other malignancies.
  D-2-HG suppresses antitumor T cell immunity but little is known about potential
  effects on non-malignant myeloid cells. Here we show that D-2-HG impairs human but
  not murine dendritic cell (DC) differentiation, resulting in a tolerogenic phenotype
  with low major histocompatibility (MHC) class II expression. In line, IDH-mutated
  AML ...
