description: We disclose an indenoannulated tridecacyclene comprising a central cyclooctatetraene
  moiety with multiple adjacent pentagonal rings which is accessible in a concise
  synthetic sequence. The saddle-shaped geometry of the non-benzenoid polycyclic scaffold
  and its unique packing behavior in the solid state were characterized by X-ray crystallography.
  In electrochemical studies, the compound undergoes seven reversible redox events
  comprising five reductions and two oxidations. The dicationic ...
