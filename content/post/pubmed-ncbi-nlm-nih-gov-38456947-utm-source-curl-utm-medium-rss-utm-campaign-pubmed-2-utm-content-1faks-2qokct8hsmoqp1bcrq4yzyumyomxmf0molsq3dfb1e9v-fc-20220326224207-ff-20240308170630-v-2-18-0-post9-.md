description: The different peaks of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) originate
  from a variety of anatomical sites in the central nervous system. The origin of
  the median nerve subcortical N18 SEP has been studied under various conditions,
  but the exact site of its generation is still unclear. While it has been claimed
  to be located in the thalamic region, other studies indicated its possible origin
  below the pontomedullary junction. Here, we scrutinized and compared SEP recordings
  from median ...
