  to our understanding of the core biological functions in eukaryotic organisms, and
  has important implications for the treatment of diseases caused by, for example,
  cancers and pathogens. Given the major constraints in testing the functions of genes
  of many organisms in the laboratory, due to the absence of in vitro cultures and/or
