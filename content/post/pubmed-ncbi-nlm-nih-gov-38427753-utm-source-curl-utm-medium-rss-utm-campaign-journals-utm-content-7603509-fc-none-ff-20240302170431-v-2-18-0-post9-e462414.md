description: It remains elusive how driver mutations, including those detected in
  circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), affect prognosis in relapsed/refractory multiple
  myeloma (RRMM). Here we performed targeted-capture sequencing using bone marrow
  plasma cells (BMPC) and ctDNA of 261 RRMM cases uniformly treated with ixazomib,
  lenalidomide, and dexamethasone in a multicenter, prospective, observational study.
  We detected 24 and 47 recurrently mutated genes in BMPC and ctDNA, respectively.
