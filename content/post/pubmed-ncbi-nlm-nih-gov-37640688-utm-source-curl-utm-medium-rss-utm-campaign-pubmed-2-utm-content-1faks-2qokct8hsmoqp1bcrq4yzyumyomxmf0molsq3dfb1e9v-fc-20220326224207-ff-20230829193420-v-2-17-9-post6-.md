description: The DNA origami technique allows fast and large scale production of DNA
  nanostructures that stand out with an accurate addressability of their anchor points.
  This enables the precise organization of guest molecules on the surfaces and results
  in diverse functionalities. However, the compatibility of DNA origami structures
  with catalytically active matter, a promising pathway to realize autonomous DNA
  machines, has so far been tested only in the context of bio-enzymatic activity,
  but not ...
