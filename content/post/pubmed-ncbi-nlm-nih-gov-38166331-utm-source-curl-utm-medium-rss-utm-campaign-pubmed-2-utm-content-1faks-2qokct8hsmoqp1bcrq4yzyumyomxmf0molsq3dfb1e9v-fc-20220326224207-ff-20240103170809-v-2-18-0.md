description: Purpose To develop a fully automated device- and sequence-independent
  convolutional neural network (CNN) for reliable and high-throughput labeling of
  heterogeneous, unstructured MRI data. Materials and Methods Retrospective, multicentric
  brain MRI data (2179 patients with glioblastoma, 8544 examinations, 63 327 sequences)
  from 249 hospitals and 29 scanner types were used to develop a network based on
  ResNet-18 architecture to differentiate nine MRI sequence types, including ...
