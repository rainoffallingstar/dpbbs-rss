description: The demand for fertility-sparing surgery (FSS) has increased in the last
  decade due to increased maternal age, increased incidence of ovarian malignancies
  in younger patients, and technical advances in surgery. Data on oncological safety
  and fertility outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer after laparoscopic FSS are
  sparse, but some retrospective studies have shown that open FSS may be offered to
  selected patients. We assessed the role of minimally invasive FSS in comparison
