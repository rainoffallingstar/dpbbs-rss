description: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a curative treatment
  for hematological malignancies. After HLA-matched alloSCT, anti-tumor immunity is
  caused by donor T cells recognizing polymorphic peptides, designated minor histocompatibility
  antigens (MiHAs), that are presented by HLA on malignant patient cells. However,
  T cells often target MiHAs on healthy non-hematopoietic tissues of patients, thereby
  inducing side effects known as Graft-versus-Host Disease. Here, we aimed to ...
