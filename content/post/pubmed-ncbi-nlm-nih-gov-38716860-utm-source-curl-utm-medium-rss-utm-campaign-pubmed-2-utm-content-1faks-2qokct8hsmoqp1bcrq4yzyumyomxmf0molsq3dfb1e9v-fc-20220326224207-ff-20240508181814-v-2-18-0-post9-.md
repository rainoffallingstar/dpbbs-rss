description: In recent years, several noncanonical RNA caps derived from cofactors
  and metabolites have been identified. Purine-containing RNA caps have been extensively
  studied, with multiple decapping enzymes identified and efficient capture and sequencing
  protocols developed for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-RNA, which allowed
  for a stepwise elucidation of capping functions. Despite being identified as an
