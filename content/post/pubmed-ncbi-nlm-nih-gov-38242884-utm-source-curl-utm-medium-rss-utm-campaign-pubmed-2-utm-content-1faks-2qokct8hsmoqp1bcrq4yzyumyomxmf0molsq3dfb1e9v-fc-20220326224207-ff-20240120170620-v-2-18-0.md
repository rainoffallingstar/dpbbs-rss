description: Hematopoietic mutations in epigenetic regulators like DNA methyltransferase
  3 alpha (DNMT3A), play a pivotal role in driving clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate
  potential (CHIP), and are associated with unfavorable outcomes in patients suffering
  from heart failure (HF). However, the precise interactions between CHIP-mutated
  cells and other cardiac cell types remain unknown. Here, we identify fibroblasts
  as potential partners in interactions with CHIP-mutated monocytes. We used ...
