description: The neuronal cell adhesion molecule contactin-4 (CNTN4) is genetically
  associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders.
  Cntn4-deficient mouse models have previously shown that CNTN4 plays important roles
  in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. However, the pathogenesis
  and functional role of CNTN4 in the cortex has not yet been investigated. Our study
  found a reduction in cortical thickness in the motor cortex of Cntn4 ^(-/-) mice,
