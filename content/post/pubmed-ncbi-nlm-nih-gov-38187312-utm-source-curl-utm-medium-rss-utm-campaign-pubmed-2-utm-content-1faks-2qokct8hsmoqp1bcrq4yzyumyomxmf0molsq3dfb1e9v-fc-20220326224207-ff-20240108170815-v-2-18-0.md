description: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, with
  heart failure being a complex condition that affects millions of individuals. Single-nucleus
  RNA sequencing has recently emerged as a powerful tool for unraveling the molecular
  mechanisms behind cardiovascular diseases. This cutting-edge technology enables
  the identification of molecular signatures, intracellular networks, and spatial
  relationships among cardiac cells, including cardiomyocytes, mast cells, ...
