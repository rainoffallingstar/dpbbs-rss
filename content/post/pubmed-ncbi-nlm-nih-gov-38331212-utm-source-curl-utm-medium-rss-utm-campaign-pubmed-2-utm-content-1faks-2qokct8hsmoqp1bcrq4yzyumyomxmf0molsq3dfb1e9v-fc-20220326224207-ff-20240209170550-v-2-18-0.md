description: The Hsp70 chaperone system is a central component of cellular protein
  quality control (PQC) by acting in a multitude of protein folding processes ranging
  from the folding of newly synthesized proteins to the disassembly and refolding
  of protein aggregates. This multifunctionality of Hsp70 is governed by J-domain
  proteins (JDPs), which act as indispensable co-chaperones that target specific substrates
  to Hsp70. The numbers of distinct JDPs present in a species always outnumbers Hsp70,
