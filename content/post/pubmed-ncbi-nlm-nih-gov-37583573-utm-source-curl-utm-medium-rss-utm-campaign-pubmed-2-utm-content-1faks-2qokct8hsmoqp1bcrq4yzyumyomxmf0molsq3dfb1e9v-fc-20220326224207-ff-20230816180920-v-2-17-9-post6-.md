description: Recovery of cardiac function is the holy grail of heart failure therapy
  yet is infrequently observed and remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed
  single-nucleus RNA sequencing from patients with heart failure who recovered left
  ventricular systolic function after left ventricular assist device implantation,
  patients who did not recover and non-diseased donors. We identified cell-specific
  transcriptional signatures of recovery, most prominently in macrophages and fibroblasts.
