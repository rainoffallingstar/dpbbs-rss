description: The presence of heterogeneity in responses to oncolytic virotherapy poses
  a barrier to clinical effectiveness, as resistance to this treatment can occur through
  the inhibition of viral spread within the tumor, potentially leading to treatment
  failures. Here we show that 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI), a chemical derivative of the
  Krebs cycle-derived metabolite itaconate, enhances oncolytic virotherapy with VSVΔ51
  in various models including human and murine resistant cancer cell ...
