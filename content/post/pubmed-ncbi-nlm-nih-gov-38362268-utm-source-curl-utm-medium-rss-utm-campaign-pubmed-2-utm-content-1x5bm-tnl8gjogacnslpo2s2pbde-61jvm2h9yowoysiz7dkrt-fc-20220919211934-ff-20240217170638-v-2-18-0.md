description: This study focuses on enhancing the prediction of regulatory functional
  sites in DNA and RNA sequences, a crucial aspect of gene regulation. Current methods,
  such as motif overrepresentation and machine learning, often lack specificity. To
  address this issue, the study leverages evolutionary information and introduces
  Graphylo, a deep-learning approach for predicting transcription factor binding sites
  in the human genome. Graphylo combines Convolutional Neural Networks for DNA sequences
