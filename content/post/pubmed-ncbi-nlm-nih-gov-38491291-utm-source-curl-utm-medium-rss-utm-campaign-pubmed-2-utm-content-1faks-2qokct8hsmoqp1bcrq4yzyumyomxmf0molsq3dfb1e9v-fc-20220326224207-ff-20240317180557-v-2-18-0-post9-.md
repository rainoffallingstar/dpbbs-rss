description: Though myocardial infarction (MI) in pigs is a well-established translational
  large animal model, it has not yet been widely used for immunotherapy studies, and
  a comprehensive description of the immune response to MI in this species is lacking.
  We induced MI in Landrace pigs by balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending
  artery over 90 min. Within 14 days, the necrotic myocardium was progressively replaced
  by scar tissue with involvement of myofibroblasts. We characterized the ...
