  signaling have led to a paradigm shift in CLL treatment. BTKis have been shown to
  reduce abnormally high CLL-associated T cell counts and the expression of immune
  checkpoint receptors concomitantly with tumor reduction. However, the impact of
  BTKi therapy on T cell function has not been fully characterized. Here, we performed
