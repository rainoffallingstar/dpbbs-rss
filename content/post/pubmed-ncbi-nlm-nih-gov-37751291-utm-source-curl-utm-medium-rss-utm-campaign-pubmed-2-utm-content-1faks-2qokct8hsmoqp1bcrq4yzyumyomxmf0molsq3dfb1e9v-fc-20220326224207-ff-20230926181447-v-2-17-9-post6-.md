description: New medicines are urgently required to treat the fatal neuromuscular
  disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a potent
  immunomodulatory small molecule nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activator
  with current clinical utility in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and psoriasis
  that could be effective for DMD and rapidly translatable. Here, we tested two weeks
  of daily 100mg/kg DMF versus 5mg/kg standard care prednisone (PRED) treatment in
