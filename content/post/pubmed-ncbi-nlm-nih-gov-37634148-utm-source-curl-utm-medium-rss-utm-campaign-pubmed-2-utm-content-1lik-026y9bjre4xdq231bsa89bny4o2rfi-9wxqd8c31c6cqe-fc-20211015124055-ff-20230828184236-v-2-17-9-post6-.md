description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation receiving
  a catheter-based therapy, pulsed field ablation was noninferior to conventional
  thermal ablation with respect to freedom from a composite of initial procedural
  failure, documented atrial tachyarrhythmia after a 3-month blanking period, antiarrhythmic
  drug use, cardioversion, or repeat ablation and with respect to device- and procedure-related
  serious adverse events at 1 year. (Funded by Farapulse-Boston Scientific; ...'
