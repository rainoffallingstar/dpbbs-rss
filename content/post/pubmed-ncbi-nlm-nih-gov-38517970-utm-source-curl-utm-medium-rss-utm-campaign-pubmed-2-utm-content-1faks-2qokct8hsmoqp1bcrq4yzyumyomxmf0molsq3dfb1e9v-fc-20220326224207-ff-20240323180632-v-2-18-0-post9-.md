description: The formation of jets in black hole accretion systems is a long-standing
  problem. It has been proposed that a jet can be formed by extracting the rotation
  energy of the black hole ("BZ-jet") or the accretion flow ("disk-jet"). While both
  models can produce collimated relativistic outflows, neither has successfully explained
  the observed jet morphology. By using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations
  and considering nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic reconnection that ...
