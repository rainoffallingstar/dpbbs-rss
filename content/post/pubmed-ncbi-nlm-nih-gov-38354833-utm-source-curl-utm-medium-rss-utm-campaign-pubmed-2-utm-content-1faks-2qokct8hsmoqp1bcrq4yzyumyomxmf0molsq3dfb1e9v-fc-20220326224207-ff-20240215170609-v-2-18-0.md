description: Early JWST observations have uncovered a new population of red sources
  that might represent a previously overlooked phase of supermassive black hole growth^(1--3).
  One of the most intriguing examples is an extremely red, point-like object that
  was found to be triply-imaged by the strong lensing (SL) cluster Abell 2744⁴. Here
  we present deep JWST/NIRSpec observations of this object, Abell2744-QSO1. The spectroscopy
  confirms that the three images are of the same object, and that it is a ...
