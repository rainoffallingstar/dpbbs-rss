description: The clinical burden of mental illness, in particular schizophrenia and
  bipolar disorder, are driven by frequent chronic courses and increased mortality,
  as well as the risk for comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and type
  2 diabetes. Evidence suggests an overlap of molecular pathways between psychotic
  disorders and somatic comorbidities. In this study, we developed a computational
