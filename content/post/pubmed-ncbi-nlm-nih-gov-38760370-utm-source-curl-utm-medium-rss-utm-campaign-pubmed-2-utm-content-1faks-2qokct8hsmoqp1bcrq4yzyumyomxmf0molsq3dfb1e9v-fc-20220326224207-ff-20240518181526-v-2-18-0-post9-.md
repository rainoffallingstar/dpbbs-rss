description: The concept of universality has shaped our understanding of many-body
  physics, but is mostly limited to homogenous systems. Here, we present a study of
  universality on a non-homogeneous graph, the long-range diluted graph (LRDG). Its
  scaling theory is controlled by a single parameter, the spectral dimension d(s),
  which plays the role of the relevant parameter on complex geometries. The graph
  under consideration allows us to tune the value of the spectral dimension continuously
  also to ...
