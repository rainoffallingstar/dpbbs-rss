description: Platelet-activating anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies and
  anti-PF4 antibodies cause heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and vaccine-induced
  immune thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (VITT), respectively. Diagnostic and treatment
  considerations differ somewhat between HIT and VITT. We identified patients with
  thrombocytopenia and thrombosis without proximate heparin exposure or adenovirus-based
  vaccination who tested strongly positive by PF4/polyanion EIA ...
