description: Cardiac remodeling is frequently observed in patients with heart failure
  (HF) and serves as an indicator of disease progression and severity. Septal hypertrophy
  represents an aspect of remodeling that can be easily assessed via an echocardiographic
  measurement of the interventricular septal end diastole (IVSd), but it has not been
  evaluated for its prognostic value, particularly in patients with heart failure
  with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF). We retrospectively included ...
