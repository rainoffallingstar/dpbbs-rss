description: Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have been used as a therapeutic intervention
  for peripheral artery disease (PAD) in clinical trials. To further explore the therapeutic
  mechanism of these mesenchymal multipotent stromal/stem cells in PAD, this study
  was designed to test the effect of xenogeneic ASCs extracted from human adipose
  tissue on hypoxic endothelial cells (ECs) and terminal unfolded protein response
  (UPR) in vitro and in an atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E-deficient ...
