description: Snowshoe hare virus (SSHV) is a zoonotic arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus)
  circulating in colder areas of the Northern Hemisphere. SSHV is maintained in an
  enzootic cycle between small mammals and mosquitoes, assumably of the genera Aedes
  and Culiseta. Symptoms of SSHV human infection can range from asymptomatic to severe
  neuroinvasive disease. Studies on SSHV transmission are limited, and there is no
  information available on whether mosquitoes of the genus Culex are able to transmit
