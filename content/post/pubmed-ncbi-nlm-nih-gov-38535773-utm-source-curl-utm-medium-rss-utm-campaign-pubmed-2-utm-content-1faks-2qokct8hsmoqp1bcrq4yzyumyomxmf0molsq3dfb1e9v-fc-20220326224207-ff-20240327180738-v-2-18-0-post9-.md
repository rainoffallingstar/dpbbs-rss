description: Detailed visualization of the cribriform plate is challenging due to
  its intricate structure. This study investigates how computed tomography (CT) with
  a novel photon counting (PC) detector enhance cribriform plate visualization compared
  to traditionally used energy-integrated detectors in patients. A total of 40 patients
  were included in a retrospective analysis, with half of them undergoing PC CT (Naeotom
  Alpha Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) and the other half undergoing CT
