description: This article focuses on improving the modeling performance of LLMs by
  finetuning them using carefully curated datasets. Specifically, this article highlights
  strategies that involve modifying, utilizing, or manipulating the datasets for instruction-based
  finetuning rather than altering the model architecture or training algorithms (the
  latter will be topics of a future article). This article will also explain how you
  can prepare your own datasets to finetune open-source ...
