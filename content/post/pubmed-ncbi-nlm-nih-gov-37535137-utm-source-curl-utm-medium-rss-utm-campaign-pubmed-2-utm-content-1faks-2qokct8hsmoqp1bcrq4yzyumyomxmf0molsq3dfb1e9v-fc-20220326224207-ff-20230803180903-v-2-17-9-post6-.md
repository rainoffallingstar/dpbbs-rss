description: Post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) is a severe and common complication after
  ischemic stroke. The role of silent aspiration as an important contributing factor
  in the development of a dysphagia-associated complications, in particular aspiration-associated
  pneumonia has been insufficiently understood. The aim of this study was to investigate
  the characteristics and risk factors of silent aspiration in patients with acute
  infratentorial stroke by FEES and to identify culprit lesions in stroke ...
