description: In diabetic nephropathy (DN), glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) and
  podocytes undergo pathological alterations, which are influenced by metabolic changes
  characteristic of diabetes, including hyperglycaemia (HG) and elevated methylglyoxal
  (MGO) levels. However, it remains insufficiently understood what effects these metabolic
  factors have on GEC and podocytes and to what extent the interactions between the
  two cell types can modulate these effects. To address these questions, we established
