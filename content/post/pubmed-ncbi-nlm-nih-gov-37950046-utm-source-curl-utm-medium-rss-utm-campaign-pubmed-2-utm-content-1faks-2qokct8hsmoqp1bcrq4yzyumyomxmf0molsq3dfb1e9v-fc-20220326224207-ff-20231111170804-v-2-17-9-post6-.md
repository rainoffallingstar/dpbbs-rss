description: Here we present a deep learning-based image analysis platform (DLAP),
  tailored to autonomously quantify cell numbers, and fluorescence signals within
  cellular compartments, derived from RNAscope or immunohistochemistry. We utilised
  DLAP to analyse subtypes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic midbrain
  neurons in mouse and human brain-sections. These neurons modulate complex behaviour,
  and are differentially affected in Parkinson's and other diseases. DLAP allows the
