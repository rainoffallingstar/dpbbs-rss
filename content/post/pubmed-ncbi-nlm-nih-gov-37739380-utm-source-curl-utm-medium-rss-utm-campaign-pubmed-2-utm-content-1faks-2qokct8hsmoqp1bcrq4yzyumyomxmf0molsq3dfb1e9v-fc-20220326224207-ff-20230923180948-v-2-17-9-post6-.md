description: The most precise measurements to date of the _{Λ}^{3}H lifetime τ and
  Λ separation energy B_{Λ} are obtained using the data sample of Pb-Pb collisions
  at sqrt[s_{NN}]=5.02 TeV collected by ALICE at the LHC. The _{Λ}^{3}H is reconstructed
  via its charged two-body mesonic decay channel (_{Λ}^{3}H→^{3}He+π^{-} and the charge-conjugate
  process). The measured values τ=[253±11(stat)±6(syst)] ps and B_{Λ}=[102±63(stat)±67(syst)]
  keV are compatible with predictions from effective field theories ...
