description: Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a complex hemostatic disturbance
  that can develop early after a major injury. There is no universally accepted definition
  of TIC. However, TIC primarily refers to the inability to achieve sufficient hemostasis
  in severely injured trauma patients, resulting in diffuse microvascular and life-threatening
  bleeding. Endogenous TIC is driven by the combination of hypovolemic shock and substantial
  tissue injury, resulting in endothelial damage, glycocalyx ...
