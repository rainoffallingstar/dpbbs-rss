description: Consumption of animal-sourced food is an important factor in broadening
  the diet of early hominins, promoting brain and body growth, and increasing behavioural
  complexity. However, whether early hominins obtained animal food by scavenging or
  hunting large mammals remains debated. Sabre-toothed felids have been proposed to
  facilitate the expansion of early Homo out of Africa into Europe 1.4-0.8 Ma by creating
  a niche for scavengers in Eurasia as the carcasses abandoned by these felids ...
