CONCLUSIONS: Of the routinely monitored indicators in PBSC donors, CD34+ cell count in PB is the most important factor in predicting G-CSF-induced PBSC yields. Higher age, female sex, WBC <30 × 10⁹/L, and a donor/recipient weight ratio <1 are useful indicators for identifying suboptimal mobilizers. The modified formula has shown successful and consistent performance in the prediction of key outcome measures including the minimum CD34+ cell collection, determination of the required length ...
