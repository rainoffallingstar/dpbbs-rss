description: This study introduces an alternative approach to immobilize thiolated
  single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) for the DNA sensing. In contrast to the standard, monomolecular
  assembly of such moieties on gold substrate, over the thiolate-gold anchors, we
  propose to use bioinert, porous polyethylene glycol (PEG) films as a 3D template
  for ssDNA immobilization. The latter process relies on the reaction between the
  thiol group of the respectively decorated ssDNA and the epoxy groups in the epoxy-rich
