description: The difference in fleece type is the distinguishing trait between the
  two types of alpacas (Vicugna pacos), Huacaya and Suri. The Suri fleece type has
  been found to be inherited dominantly over the Huacaya type, resulting in offspring
  with the Suri phenotype. The aim of our study was to map genomic regions associated
  with the two different fleece types. In this study, 91 alpacas (54 Huacayas and
  37 Suris) from Germany and Switzerland were genotyped using the 76k alpaca SNP array.
