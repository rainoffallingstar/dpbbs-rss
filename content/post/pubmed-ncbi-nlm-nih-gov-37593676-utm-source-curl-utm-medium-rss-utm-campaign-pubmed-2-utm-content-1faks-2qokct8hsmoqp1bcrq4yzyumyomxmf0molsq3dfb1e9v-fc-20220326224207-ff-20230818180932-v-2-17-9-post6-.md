description: Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved the prognosis
  of melanoma patients. However, ICIs can cause an overactivation of the immune system
  followed by diverse immunological side effects known as immune-related adverse events
  (irAE). Currently, the toxicity of irAE is limiting the usage of ICIs. Here, we
  studied circulating monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and T cells
  in course of irAE after the ICI therapy. Our longitudinal study involved 31 ...
