description: The interplay of molecules gives rise to collective phenomena absent
  in a single molecule. Many examples of collective phenomena have been reported as
  their knowledge is essential for understanding the behavior of matter. Here, we
  consider molecules sufficiently separated from each other to not form chemical bonds.
  If these molecules are excited, e.g., by a weak laser, can they concertedly relax
  by emitting a single high-energy photon possessing the total energy of all the relaxing
  molecules? ...
