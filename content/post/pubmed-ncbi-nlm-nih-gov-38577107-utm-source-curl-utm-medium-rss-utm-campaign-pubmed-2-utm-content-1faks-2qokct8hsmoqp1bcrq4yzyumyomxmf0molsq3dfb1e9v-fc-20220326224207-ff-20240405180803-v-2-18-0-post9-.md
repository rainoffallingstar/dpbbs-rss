description: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous immune population
  with diverse immunosuppressive functions in solid tumors. Here, we explored the
  role of the tumor microenvironment in regulating MDSC differentiation and immunosuppressive
  properties via signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα)/CD47 signaling. In a murine
  melanoma model, we observed progressive increases in monocytic MDSCs and monocyte-derived
  dendritic cells that exhibited potent T cell-suppressive capabilities. ...
