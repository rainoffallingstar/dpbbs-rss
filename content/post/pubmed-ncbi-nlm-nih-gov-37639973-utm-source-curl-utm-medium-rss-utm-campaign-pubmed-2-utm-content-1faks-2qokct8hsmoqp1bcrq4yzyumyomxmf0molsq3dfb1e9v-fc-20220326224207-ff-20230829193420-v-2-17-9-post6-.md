description: Despite substantial disease burden, existing evidence on the risk factors
  for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been derived primarily from cross-sectional
  studies without determining temporality. Therefore, we aimed to systematically synthesize
  the literature on longitudinal risk factors for sleep study-assessed OSA and questionnaire-assessed
  probable OSA from cohort studies in the general adult population settings. We systematically
  searched Embase and Medline (on OVID) databases. ...
