description: Kinase inhibitors (KIs) are important cancer drugs but often feature
  polypharmacology that is molecularly not understood. This disconnect is particularly
  apparent in cancer entities such as sarcomas for which the oncogenic drivers are
  often not clear. To investigate more systematically how the cellular proteotypes
  of sarcoma cells shape their response to molecularly targeted drugs, we profiled
  the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of 17 sarcoma cell lines and screened the same
