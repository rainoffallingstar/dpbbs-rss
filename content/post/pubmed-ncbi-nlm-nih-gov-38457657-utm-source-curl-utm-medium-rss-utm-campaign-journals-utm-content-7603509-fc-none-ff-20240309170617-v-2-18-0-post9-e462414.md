description: Hyperactivation of the NFκB cascade propagates oncogenic signaling and
  pro-inflammation, which together augments disease burden in myeloproliferative neoplasms
  (MPNs). Here, we systematically ablate NFκB signaling effectors to identify core
  dependencies using a series of primary samples and syngeneic and patient-derived
  xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Conditional knockout of Rela attenuated Jak2V617F
  and MPLW515L-driven onset of polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis disease hallmarks,
