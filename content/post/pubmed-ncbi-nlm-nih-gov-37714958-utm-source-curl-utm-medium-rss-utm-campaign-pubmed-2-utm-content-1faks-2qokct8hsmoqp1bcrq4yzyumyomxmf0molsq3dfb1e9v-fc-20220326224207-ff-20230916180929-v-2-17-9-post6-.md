description: The ability of chemical modifications of single nucleotides to alter
  the electrostatic charge, hydrophobic surface and base pairing of RNA molecules
  is exploited for the clinical use of stable artificial RNAs such as mRNA vaccines
  and synthetic small RNA molecules - to increase or decrease the expression of therapeutic
  proteins. Furthermore, naturally occurring biochemical modifications of nucleotides
  regulate RNA metabolism and function to modulate crucial cellular processes. Studies
