description: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with fusions of ABL-class tyrosine
  kinase genes other than BCR::ABL1 occurs in approximately 3% of children with ALL.
  The tyrosine kinase genes involved in this BCR::ABL1-like (Ph-like) subtype include
  ABL1, PDGFRB, ABL2, and CSF1R, which each have up to ten described partner genes.
  ABL-class ALL resembles BCR::ABL1-positive ALL by a similar gene expression profile,
  a poor response to chemotherapy, and sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).
