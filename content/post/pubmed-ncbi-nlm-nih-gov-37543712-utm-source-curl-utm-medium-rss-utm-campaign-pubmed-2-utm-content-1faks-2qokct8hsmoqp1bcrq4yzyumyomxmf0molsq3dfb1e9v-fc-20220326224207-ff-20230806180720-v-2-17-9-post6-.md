  autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) following carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone
  (KRd) is an option, although there is scarce data concerning this approach. We performed
  a retrospective study involving 22 EBMT-affiliated centers. Eligible MM patients
  had received a second-line treatment with KRd induction followed by a second ASCT
  between 2016 and 2018. Primary objective was to estimate progression-free survival
