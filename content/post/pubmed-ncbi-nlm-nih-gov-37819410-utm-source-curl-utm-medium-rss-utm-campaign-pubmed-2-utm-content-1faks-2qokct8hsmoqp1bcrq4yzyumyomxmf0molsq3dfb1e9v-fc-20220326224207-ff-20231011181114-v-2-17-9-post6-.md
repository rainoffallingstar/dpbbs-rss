description: A growing number of evidence supports a continued distribution of autistic
  traits in the general population. However, brain maturation trajectories of autistic
  traits as well as the influence of sex on these trajectories remain largely unknown.
  We investigated the association of autistic traits in the general population, with
  longitudinal gray matter (GM) maturation trajectories during the critical period
  of adolescence. We assessed 709 community-based adolescents (54.7% women) at age
  14 and ...
