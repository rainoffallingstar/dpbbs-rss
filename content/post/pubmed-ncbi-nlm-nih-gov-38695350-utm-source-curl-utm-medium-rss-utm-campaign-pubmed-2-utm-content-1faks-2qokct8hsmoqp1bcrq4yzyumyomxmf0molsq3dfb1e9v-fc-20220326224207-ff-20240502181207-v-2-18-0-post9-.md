description: Bacteria utilize various strategies to prevent internal dehydration during
  hypertonic stress. A common approach to countering the effects of the stress is
  to import compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, leading to simultaneous passive

  glycine betaine and deliver the substrate to the transmembrane domains for ...
