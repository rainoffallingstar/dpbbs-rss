description: We report the direct synthesis of new azulene derivatives through gold-catalyzed
  cyclization reactions. A five-membered ring as backbone in the applied triene-yne
  substrates turned out to be crucial to induce the 7-endo-dig cyclization mode necessary
  to trigger azulene formation. The obtained targets are of high interest due to their
  potential applications in different fields, like organic materials, medicine or
  cosmetics. UV/Vis spectra and cyclic voltammetry were measured, based on these ...
