description: The research aimed to identify CpG-methylation-based prognostic biomarkers
  and prediction models for colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis and validate them in
  a large external cohort. A systematic search was conducted, analyzing 298 unique
  CpGs and 12 CpG-based prognostic models from 28 studies. After adjustment for clinical
  variables, 48 CpGs and five prognostic models were confirmed to be associated with
  survival. However, the discrimination ability of the models was insufficient, with
