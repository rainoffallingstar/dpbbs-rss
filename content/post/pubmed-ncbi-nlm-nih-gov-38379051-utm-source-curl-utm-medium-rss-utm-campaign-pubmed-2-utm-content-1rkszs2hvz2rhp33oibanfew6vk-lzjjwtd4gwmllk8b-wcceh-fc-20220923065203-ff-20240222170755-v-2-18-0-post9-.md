description: The redirection of T cells has emerged as an attractive therapeutic principle
  in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). However, a detailed characterization of
  lymphoma-infiltrating T cells across B-NHL entities is missing. Here we present
  an in-depth T cell reference map of nodal B-NHL, based on cellular indexing of transcriptomes
  and epitopes, T cell receptor sequencing, flow cytometry and multiplexed immunofluorescence
  applied to 101 lymph nodes from patients with diffuse large B cell, ...
