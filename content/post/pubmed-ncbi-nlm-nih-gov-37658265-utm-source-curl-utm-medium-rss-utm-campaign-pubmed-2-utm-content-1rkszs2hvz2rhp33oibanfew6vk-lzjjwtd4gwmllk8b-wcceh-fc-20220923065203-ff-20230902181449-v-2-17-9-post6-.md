description: Chemical probes are essential tools for understanding biological systems
  and for credentialing potential biomedical targets. Programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2)
  is a member of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins, which are critical
  regulators of apoptosis. Here we report the discovery and characterization of 10e,
  a first-in-class small molecule degrader of PDCD2. We discovered PDCD2 degrader
  by serendipity using a chemical proteomics approach in contrast to the conventional
  approach ...
