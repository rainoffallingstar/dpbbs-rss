description: 2,6-Diaryl-4H-tetrahydro-thiopyran-4-ones and corresponding sulfoxide
  and sulfone derivatives were designed to lower the major toxicity of their parent
  anti-kinetoplatidal diarylideneacetones through a prodrug effect. Novel diastereoselective
  methodologies were developed and generalized from diarylideneacetones and 2,6-diaryl-4H-tetrahydro-thiopyran-4-ones
  to allow the introduction of a wide substitution profile and to prepare the related
  S-oxides. The in vitro biological activity ...
