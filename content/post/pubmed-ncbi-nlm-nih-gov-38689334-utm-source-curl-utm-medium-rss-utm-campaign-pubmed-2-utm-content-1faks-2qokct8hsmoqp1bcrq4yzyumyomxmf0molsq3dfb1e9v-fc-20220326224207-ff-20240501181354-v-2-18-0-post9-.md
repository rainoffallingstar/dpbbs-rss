description: 'CONCLUSIONS: BMP4 expression is required for suppression of metastasis
  regardless of the SMAD4 status of the tumor cells. Since BMP4 is a secreted protein,
  we conclude that it can act both in an autocrine manner in SMAD4-expressing tumor
  cells and in a paracrine manner on stromal cells to suppress metastasis. Deletion
  of SMAD4 from tumor cells does not prevent BMP4 from suppressing metastasis via
  a paracrine ...'
