description: White blood cells (WBCs) play a vital role in immune responses against
  infections and foreign agents. Different WBC types exist, and anomalies within them
  can indicate diseases like leukemia. Previous research suffers from limited accuracy
  and inflated performance due to the usage of less important features. Moreover,
  these studies often focus on fewer WBC types, exaggerating accuracy. This study
  addresses the crucial task of classifying WBC types using microscopic images. This
