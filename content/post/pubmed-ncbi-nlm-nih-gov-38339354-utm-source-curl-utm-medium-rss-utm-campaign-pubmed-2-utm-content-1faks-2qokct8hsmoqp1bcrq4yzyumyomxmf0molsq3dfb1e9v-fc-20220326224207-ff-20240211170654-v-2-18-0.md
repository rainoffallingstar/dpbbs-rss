description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
  deaths worldwide. The high mortality is directly associated with metastatic disease,
  which is thought to be initiated by colon cancer stem cells, according to the cancer
  stem cell (CSC) model. Consequently, early identification of those patients who
  are at high risk for metastasis is crucial for improved treatment and patient outcomes.
