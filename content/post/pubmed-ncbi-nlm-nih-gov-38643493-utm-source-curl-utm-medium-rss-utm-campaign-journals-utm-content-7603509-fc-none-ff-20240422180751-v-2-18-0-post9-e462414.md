description: Numerous antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are being developed for cancer
  immunotherapy. Although several of these agents have demonstrated considerable clinical
  efficacy and have won FDA approval, in many instances they have been characterized
  by adverse side effects (ASE) which can be quite severe in a fraction of treated
  patients. The key hypothesis in this perspective is that many of the most serious
