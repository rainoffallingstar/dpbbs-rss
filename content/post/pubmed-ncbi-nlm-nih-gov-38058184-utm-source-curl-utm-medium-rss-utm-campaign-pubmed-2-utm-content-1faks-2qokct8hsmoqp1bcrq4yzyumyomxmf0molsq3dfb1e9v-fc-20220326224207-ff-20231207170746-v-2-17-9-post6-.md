description: We evaluated 58 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) acute B-lymphoblastic
  leukemia (B-ALL; median age, 42.5 years; range, 16-69 years), treated with inotuzumab
  ozogamicin (INO) between 2016-2022 and who received an allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) consecutively. Forty-seven (81%) of the 58
  patients were heavily pretreated receiving intensive chemotherapy +/- TKI, blinatumomab
  in 24 (41%) and allo-HCT at first-line in 11 (19%) patients. Complete remission
