description: Constitutional heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes coding for some
  components of the Fanconi anemia-BRCA signaling pathway, which repairs DNA interstrand
  crosslinks, represent risk factors for common cancers, including breast, ovarian,
  pancreatic and prostate cancer. A high cancer risk is also a main clinical feature
  in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare condition characterized by bone marrow
  failure, endocrine and physical abnormalities. The mainly recessive condition is
