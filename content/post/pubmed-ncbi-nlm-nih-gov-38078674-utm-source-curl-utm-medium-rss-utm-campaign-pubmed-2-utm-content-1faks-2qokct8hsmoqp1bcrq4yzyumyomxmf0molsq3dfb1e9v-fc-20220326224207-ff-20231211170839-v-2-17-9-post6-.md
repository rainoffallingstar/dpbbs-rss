description: Plasmonic nanoparticles have the capacity to confine electromagnetic
  fields to the subwavelength regime and provide strong coupling with few or even
  a single emitter at room temperature. The photophysical properties of the emitters
  are highly dependent on the relative distance and orientation between them and the
  nanocavity. Therefore, there is a need for accurate and general light-matter interaction
  models capable of guiding their design in application-oriented devices. In this
