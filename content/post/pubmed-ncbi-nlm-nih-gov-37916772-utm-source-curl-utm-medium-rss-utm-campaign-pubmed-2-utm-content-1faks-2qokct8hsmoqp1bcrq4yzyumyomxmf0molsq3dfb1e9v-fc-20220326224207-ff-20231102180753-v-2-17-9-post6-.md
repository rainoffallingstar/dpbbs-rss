description: Biological pattern formation is essential for generating and maintaining
  spatial structures from the scale of a single cell to tissues and even collections
  of organisms. Besides biochemical interactions, there is an important role for mechanical
  and geometrical features in the generation of patterns. We review the theoretical
  principles underlying different types of mechanochemical pattern formation across
  spatial scales and levels of biological ...
