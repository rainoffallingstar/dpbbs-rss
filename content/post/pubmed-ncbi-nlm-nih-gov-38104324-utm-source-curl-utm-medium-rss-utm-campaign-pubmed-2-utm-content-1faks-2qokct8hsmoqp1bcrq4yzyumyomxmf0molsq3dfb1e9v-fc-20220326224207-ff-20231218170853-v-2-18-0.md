description: Lassa virus is a negative-strand RNA virus with only four structural
  proteins that causes periodic outbreaks in West Africa. The nucleoprotein (NP) encapsidates
  the viral genome, forming ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) together with the viral
  RNA and the L protein. RNPs must be continuously restructured during viral genome
  replication and transcription. The Z protein is important for membrane recruitment
  of RNPs, viral particle assembly, and budding and has also been shown to interact
