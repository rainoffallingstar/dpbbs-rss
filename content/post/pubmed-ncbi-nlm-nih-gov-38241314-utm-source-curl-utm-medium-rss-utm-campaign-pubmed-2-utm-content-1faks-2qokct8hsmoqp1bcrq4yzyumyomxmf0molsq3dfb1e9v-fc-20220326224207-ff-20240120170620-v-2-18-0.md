description: Pathologists routinely use immunohistochemical (IHC)-stained tissue slides
  against MelanA in addition to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides to improve
  their accuracy in diagnosing melanomas. The use of diagnostic Deep Learning (DL)-based
  support systems for automated examination of tissue morphology and cellular composition
  has been well studied in standard H&E-stained tissue slides. In contrast, there
  are few studies that analyze IHC slides using DL. Therefore, we investigated ...
