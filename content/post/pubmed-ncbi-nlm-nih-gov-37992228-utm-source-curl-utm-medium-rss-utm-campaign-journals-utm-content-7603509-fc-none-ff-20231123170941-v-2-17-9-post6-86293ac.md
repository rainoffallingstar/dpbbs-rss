description: Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is associated with episodic kinin-induced
  swelling of skin and mucosal membranes. Most HAE patients have low plasma C1-inhibitor
  activity, leading to increased generation of the protease plasma kallikrein (PKa)
  and excessive release of the nanopeptide bradykinin from high-molecular-weight kininogen
  (HK). However, disease causing mutations in at least 10% of HAE patients appear
  to involve genes for proteins other than C1-inhibitor. A point mutation in the Kng1
