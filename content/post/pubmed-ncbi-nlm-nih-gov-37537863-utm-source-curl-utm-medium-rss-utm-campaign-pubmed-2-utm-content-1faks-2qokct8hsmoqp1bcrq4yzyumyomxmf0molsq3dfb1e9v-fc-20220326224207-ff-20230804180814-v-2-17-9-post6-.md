description: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a giant extracellular glycoprotein that
  carries out a key adhesive function during primary hemostasis. Upon vascular injury
  and triggered by the shear of flowing blood, VWF establishes specific interactions
  with several molecular partners in order to anchor platelets to collagen on the
  exposed sub-endothelial surface. VWF also interacts with itself to form aggregates
  that, adsorbed on the surface, provide more anchor sites for the platelets. However,
