description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors are composed of heterogeneous and plastic
  cell populations, including a pool of cancer stem cells that express LGR5. Whether
  these distinct cell populations display different mechanical properties, and how
  these properties might contribute to metastasis is poorly understood. Using CRC
  patient derived organoids (PDOs), we find that compared to LGR5- cells, LGR5+ cancer
  stem cells are stiffer, adhere better to the extracellular matrix (ECM), move slower
