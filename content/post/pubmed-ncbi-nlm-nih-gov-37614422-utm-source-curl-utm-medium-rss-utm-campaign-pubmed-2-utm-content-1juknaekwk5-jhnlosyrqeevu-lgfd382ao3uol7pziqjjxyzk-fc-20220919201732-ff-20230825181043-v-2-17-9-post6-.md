description: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is one of the most common infectious
  complications following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); however,
  cases involving multiple organs at the same time are rare. The present study describes
  a case of CMV pneumonia combined with CMV DNAemia and CMV cystitis after HSCT. A
  33-year-old male patient with acute myeloid leukemia was treated with HSCT. The
  first month after HSCT, the patient developed a cough and shortness of breath. At
