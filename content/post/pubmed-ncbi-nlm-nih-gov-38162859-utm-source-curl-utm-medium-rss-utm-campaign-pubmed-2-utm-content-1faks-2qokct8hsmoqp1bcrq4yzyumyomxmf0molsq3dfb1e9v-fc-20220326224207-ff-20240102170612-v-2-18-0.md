description: Recent data, indicating that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be
  a risk factor for future chronic kidney disease, highlight the need to study the
  safety and clinical effectiveness of advanced IBD therapies in patients with end

  a selective oral Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in the
  management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. There is also emerging data
