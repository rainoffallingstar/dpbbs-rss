description: Antibiotic-loaded PMMA bone cement is frequently used in modern trauma
  and orthopedic surgery. Although many of the antibiotics routinely applied are described
  to have cytotoxic effects in the literature, clinical experience shows no adverse
  effects for bone healing. To determine the effects of antibiotic-loaded PMMA spacers
  on osteogenesis in vitro, we cultivated human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
  (BM-hMSCs) in the presence of PMMA spacers containing Gentamicin, Vancomycin, Gentamicin
