description: Although dietary fructose is associated with an elevated risk for pancreatic
  cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that ketohexokinase
  (KHK), the rate-limiting enzyme of fructose metabolism, is a driver of PDAC development.
  We demonstrate that fructose triggers KHK and induces fructolytic gene expression
  in mouse and human PDAC. Genetic inactivation of KhkC enhances the survival of KPC-driven
  PDAC even in the absence of high fructose diet. Furthermore, it ...
