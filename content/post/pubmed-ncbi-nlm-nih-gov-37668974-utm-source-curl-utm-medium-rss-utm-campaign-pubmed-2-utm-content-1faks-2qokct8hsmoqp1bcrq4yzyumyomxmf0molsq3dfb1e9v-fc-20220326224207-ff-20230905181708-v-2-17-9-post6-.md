description: The SH2-binding phosphotyrosine class of short linear motifs (SLiMs)
  are key conditional regulatory elements, particularly in signaling protein complexes
  beneath the cell's plasma membrane. In addition to transmitting cellular signaling
  information, they can also play roles in cellular hijack by invasive pathogens.
  Researchers can take advantage of bioinformatics tools and resources to predict
  the motifs at conserved phosphotyrosine residues in regions of intrinsically disordered
  protein. ...
