description: This paper reports on a novel approach for the fabrication of composite
  multilayered bioink-nanofibers construct. This work achieves this by using a hands-free
  3D (bio)printing integrated touch-spinning approach. Additionally, this work investigates
  the interaction of fibroblasts in different bioinks with the highly aligned touch-spun
  nanofibers. This work conducts a comprehensive characterization of the rheological
  properties of the inks, starting with low-strain oscillatory rheology to ...
