description: The excited states of unstable ^{20}O were investigated via γ-ray spectroscopy
  following the ^{19}O(d,p)^{20}O reaction at 8 AMeV. By exploiting the Doppler shift
  attenuation method, the lifetimes of the 2_{2}^{+} and 3_{1}^{+} states were firmly
  established. From the γ-ray branching and E2/M1 mixing ratios for transitions deexciting
  the 2_{2}^{+} and 3_{1}^{+} states, the B(E2) and B(M1) were determined. Various
  chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians, describing the nuclear ...
