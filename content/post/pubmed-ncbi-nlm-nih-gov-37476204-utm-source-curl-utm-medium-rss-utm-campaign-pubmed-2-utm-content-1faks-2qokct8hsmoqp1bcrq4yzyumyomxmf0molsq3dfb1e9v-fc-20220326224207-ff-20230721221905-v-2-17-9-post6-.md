description: Leukocytes and resident cells in the arterial wall contribute to atherosclerosis,
  especially at sites of disturbed blood flow. Expression of endothelial Tie1 receptor
  tyrosine kinase is enhanced at these sites, and attenuation of its expression reduces
  atherosclerotic burden and decreases inflammation. However, Tie2 tyrosine kinase
  function in atherosclerosis is unknown. Here we provide genetic evidence from humans
  and from an atherosclerotic mouse model to show that TIE2 is associated ...
