description: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous and prevalent
  subtype of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma that poses diagnostic and prognostic
  challenges, particularly in predicting drug responsiveness. In this study, we used
  digital pathology and deep learning to predict responses to immunochemotherapy in
  patients with DLBCL. We retrospectively collected 251 slide images from 216 DLBCL
  patients treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and
  prednisone ...
