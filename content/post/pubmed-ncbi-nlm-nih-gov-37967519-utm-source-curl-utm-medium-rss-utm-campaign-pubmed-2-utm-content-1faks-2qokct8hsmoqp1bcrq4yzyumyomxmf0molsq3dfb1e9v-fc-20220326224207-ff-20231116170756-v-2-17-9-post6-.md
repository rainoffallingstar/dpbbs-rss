description: Antibacterial materials composed of biodegradable and biocompatible constituents
  that are produced via eco-friendly synthetic strategies will become an attractive
  alternative to antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this study,
  we demonstrated the antibacterial properties of nanosheet-shaped crystalline assemblies
  of enzymatically synthesized aminated cellulose oligomers (namely, surface-aminated
  synthetic nanocelluloses) and their synergy with a metal-chelating ...
