description: Thyroid cancer (TC) is substantially more common in women than in men,
  pointing to a possible role of sex steroid hormones. We investigated the association
  between circulating sex steroid hormones, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and
  the risk of differentiated TC in men and women within the European Prospective Investigation
  into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) cohort. During follow-up, we identified 333 first
  primary incident cases of differentiated TC (152 in pre/peri-menopausal women, 111
