description: Optogenetic actuators are rapidly advancing tools used to control physiology
  in excitable cells, such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. In neuroscience, these tools
  have been used to either excite or inhibit neuronal activity. Cell type-targeted
  actuators have allowed to study the function of distinct cell populations. Whereas
  the first described cation channelrhodopsins allowed to excite specific neuronal
  cell populations, anion channelrhodopsins were used to inhibit neuronal activity.
