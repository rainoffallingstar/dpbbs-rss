description: EphB6 is an understudied ephrin receptor tyrosine pseudokinase that is
  downregulated in multiple types of metastatic cancers. Unlike its kinase-active
  counterparts which autophosphorylate and transmit signals upon intercellular interaction,
  little is known about how EphB6 functions in the absence of intrinsic kinase activity.
  Here, we unveil a molecular mechanism of cell-cell interaction driven by EphB6.
  We identify ephrinB1 as a cognate ligand of EphB6 and show that in trans interaction
