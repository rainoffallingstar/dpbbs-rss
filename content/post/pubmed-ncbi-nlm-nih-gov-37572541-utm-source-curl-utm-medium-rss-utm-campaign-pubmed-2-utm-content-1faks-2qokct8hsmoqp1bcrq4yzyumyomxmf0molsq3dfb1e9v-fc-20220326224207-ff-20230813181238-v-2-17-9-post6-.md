description: Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by unprovoked and
  recurrent seizures, of which 60% are of unknown etiology. Recent studies implicate
  microglia in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. However, their role in this process,
  in particular following early-life seizures, remains poorly understood due in part
  to the lack of suitable experimental models allowing the in vivo imaging of microglial
  activity. Given the advantage of zebrafish larvae for minimally-invasive imaging
  approaches, ...
