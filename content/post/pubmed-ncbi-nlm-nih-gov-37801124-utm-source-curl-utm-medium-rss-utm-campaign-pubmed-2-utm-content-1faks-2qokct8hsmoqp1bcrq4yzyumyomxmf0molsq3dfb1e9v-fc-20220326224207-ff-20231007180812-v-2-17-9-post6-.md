description: This study is aimed to determine whether postoperative low dose computed
  tomography (LDCT) imaging is necessary after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL),
  or the surgeon's intraoperative assessment of residual fragments (RF) is sufficient
  and avoidance of postoperative imaging with reduction of radiation exposure can
  be achieved. Data of all 610 patients who underwent PCNL in prone position in our
  institution from February 2009 to September 2020 was collected. Parameters such
  as age, ...
