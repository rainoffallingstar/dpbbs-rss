  a consolidation for patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) due to the
  poor prognosis associated with this heterogenous group of disorders. However, a
  significant number of patients will experience post-AHCT disease relapse. Here,
  we report a retrospective study of consecutive 124 patients with PTCLs who underwent
  AHCT from 2008 to 2020. With a median follow-up of 6.01 years following AHCT, 49
