description: Isogenic cells respond in a heterogeneous manner to interferon. Using
  a micropatterning approach combined with high-content imaging and spatial analyses,
  we characterized how the population context (position of a cell with respect to
  neighboring cells) of epithelial cells affects their response to interferons. We
  identified that cells at the edge of cellular colonies are more responsive than
  cells embedded within colonies. We determined that this spatial heterogeneity in
