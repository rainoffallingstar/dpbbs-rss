description: The plus-end directed actin-dependent motor protein, myosin Va, is of
  particular relevance for outward vesicular protein trafficking and for restraining
  specific cargo vesicles within the actin cortex. The latter is a preferred site
  of cAMP production, and the specificity of cAMP signaling is largely mediated through
  the formation of microdomains that spatially couple localized metabotropic receptor
  activity and cAMP production to selected effectors and downstream targets. This
