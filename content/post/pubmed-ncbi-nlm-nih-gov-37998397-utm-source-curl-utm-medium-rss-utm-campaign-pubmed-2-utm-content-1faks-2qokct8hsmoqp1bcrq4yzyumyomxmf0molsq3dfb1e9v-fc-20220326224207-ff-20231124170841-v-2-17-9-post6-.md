description: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an archetypal ciliopathy caused by dysfunction
  of primary cilia. BBS affects multiple tissues, including the kidney, eye and hypothalamic
  satiety response. Understanding pan-tissue mechanisms of pathogenesis versus those
  which are tissue-specific, as well as gauging their associated inter-individual
  variation owing to genetic background and stochastic processes, is of paramount
  importance in syndromology. The BBSome is a membrane-trafficking and ...
