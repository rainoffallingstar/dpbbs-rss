description: Single molecule localization microscopy offers resolution nearly down
  to the molecular level with specific molecular labelling, and is thereby a promising
  tool for structural biology. In practice, however, the actual value to this field
  is limited primarily by incomplete fluorescent labelling of the structure. This
  missing information can be completed by merging information from many structurally
  identical particles in a particle fusion approach similar to cryo-EM single-particle
  analysis. ...
