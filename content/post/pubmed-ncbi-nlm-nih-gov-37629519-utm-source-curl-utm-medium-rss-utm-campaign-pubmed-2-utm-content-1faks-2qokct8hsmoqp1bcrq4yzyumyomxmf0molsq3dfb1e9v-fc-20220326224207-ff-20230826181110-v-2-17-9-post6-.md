description: Alcohol effect hepatic lipid metabolism through various mechanisms, leading
  synergistically to an accumulation of fatty acids (FA) and triglycerides. Obesity,
  as well as dietary fat (saturated fatty acids (FA) versus poly-unsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFA)) may modulate the hepatic fat. Alcohol inhibits adenosine monophosphate
  activated kinase (AMPK). AMPK activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
  a (PPARα) and leads to a decreased activation of sterol regulatory element binding
