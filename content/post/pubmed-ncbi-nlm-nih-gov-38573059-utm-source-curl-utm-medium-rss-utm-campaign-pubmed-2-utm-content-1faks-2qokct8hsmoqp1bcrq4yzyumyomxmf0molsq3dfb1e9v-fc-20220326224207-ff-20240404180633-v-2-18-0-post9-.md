description: Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) comprise the second most common
  group of neoplasms in childhood. The incidence of germline predisposition among
  children with brain tumors continues to grow as our knowledge on disease aetiology
  increases. Some children with brain tumors may present with non-malignant phenotypic
  features of specific syndromes (e.g. nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, neurofibromatosis
  type 1 and type 2, DICER1 syndrome, and constitutional mismatch repair ...
