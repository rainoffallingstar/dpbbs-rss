description: The preoperative distinction between glioblastoma (GBM) and primary central
  nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) can be difficult, even for experts, but is highly
  relevant. We aimed to develop an easy-to-use algorithm, based on a convolutional
  neural network (CNN) to preoperatively discern PCNSL from GBM and systematically
  compare its performance to experienced neurosurgeons and radiologists. To this end,
  a CNN-based on DenseNet169 was trained with the magnetic resonance (MR)-imaging
  data of 68 ...
