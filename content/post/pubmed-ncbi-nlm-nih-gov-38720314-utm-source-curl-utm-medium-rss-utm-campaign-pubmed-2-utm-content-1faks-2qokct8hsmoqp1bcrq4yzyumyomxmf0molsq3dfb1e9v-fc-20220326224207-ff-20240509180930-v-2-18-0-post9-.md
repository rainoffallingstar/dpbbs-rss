  for enriching CTCs from DLA, resulting in a substantial increase in CTC numbers.
  This allowed the creation of the first-ever single-cell whole transcriptome in-depth
  characterization of the heterogeneity of over 3,300 NSCLC-CTCs. The findings not
  only confirm the diagnostic value of CTCs in monitoring tumor heterogeneity but
  also propose a CTC-specific signature that can be exploited for targeted CTC-directed
