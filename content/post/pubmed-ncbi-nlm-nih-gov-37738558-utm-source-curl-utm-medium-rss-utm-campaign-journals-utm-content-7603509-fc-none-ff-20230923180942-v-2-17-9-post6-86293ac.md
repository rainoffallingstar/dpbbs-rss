description: Sialic acids occupy the terminal position of glycan chains and have the
  potential to influence the antigenicity of glycoproteins. The polymorphisms of Human
  Platelet Alloantigens (HPA)-3 and HPA-9, locating near the C-terminus of the extracellular
  domain of platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP)IIb, are adjacent to sialyl-Core 1
  O-glycans emanating from serines 845 and 847. Whether the nearby O-glycans affect
  the antigenicity of HPA-9b, and/or influence the binding of anti-HPA-9b alloantibodies
