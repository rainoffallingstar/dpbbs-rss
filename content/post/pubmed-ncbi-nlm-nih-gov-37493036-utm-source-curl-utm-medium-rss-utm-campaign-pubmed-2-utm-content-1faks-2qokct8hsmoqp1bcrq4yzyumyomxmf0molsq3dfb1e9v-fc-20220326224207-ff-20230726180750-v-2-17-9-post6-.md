  a (pragmatic) randomized controlled trial (RCT). This approach is costly, time-consuming,
  and not always practicable. At the same time, huge quantities of available patient-level
  control condition data in analyzable format of (former) RCTs or real-world data
  (RWD) are neglected. Therefore, alternative study designs are desirable. The design
