description: Chromatin modifications are linked with regulating patterns of gene expression,
  but their causal role and context-dependent impact on transcription remains unresolved.
  Here we develop a modular epigenome editing platform that programs nine key chromatin
  modifications, or combinations thereof, to precise loci in living cells. We couple
  this with single-cell readouts to systematically quantitate the magnitude and heterogeneity
  of transcriptional responses elicited by each specific ...
