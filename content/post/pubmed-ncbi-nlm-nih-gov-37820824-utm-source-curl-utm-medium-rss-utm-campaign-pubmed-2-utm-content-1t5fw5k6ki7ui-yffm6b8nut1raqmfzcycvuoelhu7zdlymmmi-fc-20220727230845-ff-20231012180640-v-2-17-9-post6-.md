description: Accumulating studies have indicated that N6-methyladenosine (m⁶A) plays
  an important role in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, little is known about
  the m⁶A methylome at a transcriptome-wide scale in AML patients. We obtained three
  pairs of bone marrow (BM) samples from cytogenetically normal AML patients at the
  timepoints of diagnosis (AML) and relapse (R_AML) and three BM samples from healthy
  donors used as normal controls (NCs). Methylated RNA immunoprecipitation ...
