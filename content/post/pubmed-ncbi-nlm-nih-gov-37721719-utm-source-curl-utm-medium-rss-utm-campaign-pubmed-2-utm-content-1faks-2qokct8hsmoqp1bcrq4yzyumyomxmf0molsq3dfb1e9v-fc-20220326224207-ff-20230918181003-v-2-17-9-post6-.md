description: Interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) is an ultrafast non-radiative electronic
  decay process wherein an excited atom transfers its excess energy to a neighboring
  species leading to the ionization of the latter. In helium clusters, ICD can take
  place, for example, after simultaneous ionization and excitation of one helium atom
  within the cluster. After ICD, two helium ions are created and the system undergoes
  a Coulomb explosion. In this work, we investigate theoretically ICD in small helium
