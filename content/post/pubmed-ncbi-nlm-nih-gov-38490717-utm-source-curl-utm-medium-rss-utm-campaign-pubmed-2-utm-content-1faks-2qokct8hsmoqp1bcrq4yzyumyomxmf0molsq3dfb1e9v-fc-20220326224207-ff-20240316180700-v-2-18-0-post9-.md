description: Centrioles play important roles in the assembly of centrosomes and cilia.
  Centriole duplication occurs once per cell cycle and is dependent on polo-like kinase
  4 (PLK4). To prevent centriole amplification, which is a hallmark of cancer, PLK4
  protein levels need to be tightly regulated. Here, we show that the Cullin4A/B-DDB1-DCAF1,
  CRL4^(DCAF1), E3 ligase targets PLK4 for degradation in human cells. DCAF1 binds
  and ubiquitylates PLK4 in the G2 phase to prevent premature centriole duplication
