description: Similar to the optical diffraction of light passing through a material
  grating, the Kapitza-Dirac effect occurs when an electron is diffracted by a standing
  light wave. In its original description, the effect is time independent. Here, we
  extended the Kapitza-Dirac effect to the time domain. By tracking the spatiotemporal
  evolution of a pulsed electron wave packet diffracted by a 60-femtosecond (where
  one femtosecond = 10^(-15) seconds) standing wave pulse in a pump-probe scheme,
  we ...
