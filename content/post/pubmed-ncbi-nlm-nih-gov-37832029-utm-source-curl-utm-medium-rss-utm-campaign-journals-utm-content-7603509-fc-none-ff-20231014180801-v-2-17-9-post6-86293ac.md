description: Elevated circulating fibrinogen correlates with increased risk for both
  cardiovascular and venous thromboembolic diseases. In vitro studies show that formation
  of a highly dense fibrin matrix is a major determinant of clot structure and stability.
  Here, we analyzed the impact of nonpolymerizable fibrinogen on arterial and venous
  thrombosis as well as hemostasis in vivo using FgaEK mice that express normal levels
  of a fibrinogen that cannot be cleaved by thrombin. In a model of carotid ...
