description: The objective of the study is to evaluate the evolving phenotype and
  genetic spectrum of patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency
  (SSADHD) in long-term follow-up. Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 22
  pediatric and 9 adult individuals with SSADHD from the patient registry of the International
  Working Group on Neurotransmitter related Disorders (iNTD) were studied with in
  silico analyses, pathogenicity scores and molecular modeling of ALDH5A1 variants.
