description: The pleiotropic alarmin interleukin-33 (IL-33) drives type 1, type 2
  and regulatory T-cell responses via its receptor ST2. Subset-specific differences
  in ST2 expression intensity and dynamics suggest that transcriptional regulation
  is key in orchestrating the context-dependent activity of IL-33-ST2 signaling in
  T-cell immunity. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized alternative promoter
  in mice and humans that is located far upstream of the curated ST2-coding gene and
  drives ST2 ...
