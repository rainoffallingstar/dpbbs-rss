description: Site-specific carbon isotope ratio measurements by quantitative ^(13)C
  NMR (^(13)C-qNMR), Orbitrap-MS, and GC-IRMS offer a new dimension to conventional
  bulk carbon isotope ratio measurements used in food provenance, forensics, and a
  number of other applications. While the site-specific measurements of carbon isotope
  ratios in vanillin by ^(13)C-qNMR or Orbitrap-MS are powerful new tools in food
  analysis, there are a limited number of studies regarding the validity of these
