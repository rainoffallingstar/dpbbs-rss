description: Circulating calcitriol may contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease
  (CVD), but its regulation in patients with CVD is poorly characterized. We therefore
  aimed to assess determinants of circulating calcitriol in these patients. We analyzed
  2183 independent samples from a large cohort of patients scheduled for coronary
  angiography and 1727 independent samples from different other cohorts from patients
  with a wide range of CVDs, including heart transplant candidates, to quantify ...
