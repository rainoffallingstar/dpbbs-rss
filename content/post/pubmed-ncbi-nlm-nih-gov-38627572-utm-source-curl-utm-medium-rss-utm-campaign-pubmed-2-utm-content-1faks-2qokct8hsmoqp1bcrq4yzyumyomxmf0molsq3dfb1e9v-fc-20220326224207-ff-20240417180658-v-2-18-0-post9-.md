description: Inspired by recent findings in the visual domain, we investigated whether
  the stimulus-evoked pupil dilation reflects temporal statistical regularities in
  sequences of auditory stimuli. We conducted two preregistered pupillometry experiments
  (experiment 1, n = 30, 21 females; experiment 2, n = 31, 22 females). In both experiments,
  human participants listened to sequences of spoken vowels in two conditions. In
  the first condition, the stimuli were presented in a random order and, in the ...
