description: Paclitaxel (PTX) is a potent anticancer drug. In the present study, PTX
  was loaded in poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalarate (PHBV) to fabricate the
  PTX/PHBV (drug-loaded) nanoparticles via the nanoprecipitation method. Blank PHBV
  nanoparticles were also prepared. The drug-encapsulation efficiency of PTX/PHBV
  nanoparticles was 45±0.4%. The PTX/PHBV nanoparticles exhibited a pH-sensitive release
  profile and followed a quasi-Fickian diffusion mechanism. Cytotoxic properties of
  PHBV ...
