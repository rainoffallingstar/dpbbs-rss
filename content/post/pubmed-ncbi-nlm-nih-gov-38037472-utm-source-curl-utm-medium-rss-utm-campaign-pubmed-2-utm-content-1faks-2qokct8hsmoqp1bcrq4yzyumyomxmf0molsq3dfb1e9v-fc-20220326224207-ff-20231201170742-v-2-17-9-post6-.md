description: Brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in children.
  Experimental in vitro models that faithfully capture the hallmarks and tumor heterogeneity
  of pediatric brain cancers are limited and hard to establish. We present a protocol
  that enables efficient generation, expansion, and biobanking of pediatric brain
  cancer organoids. Utilizing our protocol, we have established patient-derived organoids
  (PDOs) from ependymomas, medulloblastomas, low-grade glial tumors, ...
