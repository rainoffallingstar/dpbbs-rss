description: We prepared and characterized (UV-vis, epr, X-ray) four substituted nonacenes.
  They are the most stable and soluble nonacenes to date - due to six strategically
  placed triisopropylsilyl (TIPS)-ethynyl groups. They are stable for several weeks
  in the solid state. In dilute solution their half-life is 5-9 h. Crystal structure
  analyses of two nonacenes prove their structures. A nonacene derivative was tested
  in a solution-processed transistor and exhibits ambipolar charge transport ...
