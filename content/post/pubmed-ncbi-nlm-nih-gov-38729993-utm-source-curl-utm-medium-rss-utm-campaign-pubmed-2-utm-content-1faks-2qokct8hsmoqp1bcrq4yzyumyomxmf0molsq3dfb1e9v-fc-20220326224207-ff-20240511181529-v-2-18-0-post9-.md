description: MYC plays various roles in pluripotent stem cells, including the promotion
  of somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency, the regulation of cell competition
  and the control of embryonic diapause. However, how Myc expression is regulated
  in this context remains unknown. The Myc gene lies within a ~ 3-megabase gene desert
  with multiple cis-regulatory elements. Here we use genomic rearrangements, transgenesis
  and targeted mutation to analyse Myc regulation in early mouse embryos and ...
