description: As Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) often present as metastatic lesions, immunohistochemical
  assignment to a site of origin is one of the most important tasks in their pathological
  assessment. Since a fraction of NETs eludes the typical expression profiles of their
  primary localization, additional sensitive and specific markers are required to
  improve diagnostic certainty. We investigated the expression of the transcription
  factor Pituitary Homeobox 2 (PITX2) in a large-scale cohort of 909 NET ...
