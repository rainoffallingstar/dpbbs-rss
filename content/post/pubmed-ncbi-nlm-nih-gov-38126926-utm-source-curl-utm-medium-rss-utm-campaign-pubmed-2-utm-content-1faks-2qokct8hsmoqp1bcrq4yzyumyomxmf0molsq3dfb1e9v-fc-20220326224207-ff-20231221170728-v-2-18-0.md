description: Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) play a significant role in the delivery
  of cargos into human cells. We report the first CPPs based on peptide-bismuth bicycles,
  which can be readily obtained from commercially available peptide precursors, making
  them accessible for a wide range of applications. These CPPs enter mammalian cells
  as demonstrated by live-cell microscopy using fluorescently labelled peptides. We
  report efficient sequences that demonstrate increased cellular uptake compared ...
