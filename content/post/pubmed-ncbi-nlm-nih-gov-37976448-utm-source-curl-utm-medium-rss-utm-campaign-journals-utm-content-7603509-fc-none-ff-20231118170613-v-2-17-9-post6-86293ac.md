description: In the field of Transfusion Medicine, the clinical relevance of the metabolic
  markers of the red blood cell (RBC) storage lesion is incompletely understood. Here
  we performed metabolomics of RBC units from 643 donors enrolled in the Recipient
  Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study - REDS RBC Omics. These units were tested
  at storage day 10, 23 and 42 for a total of 1,929 samples, and also characterized
  for end of storage hemolytic propensity following oxidative and osmotic insults.
