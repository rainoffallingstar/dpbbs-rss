description: Plumbagin is used in traditional medicine because of its anti-inflammatory
  and anti-microbial properties. As a naphthoquinone, plumbagin triggers the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In vitro cancer studies showed that plumbagin
  triggers apoptosis in cancer cells through ROS production. As cancer-mediated chronic
  inflammation can affect bone density, it was hypothesized that plumbagin might directly
  inhibit the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. We previously showed that ...
