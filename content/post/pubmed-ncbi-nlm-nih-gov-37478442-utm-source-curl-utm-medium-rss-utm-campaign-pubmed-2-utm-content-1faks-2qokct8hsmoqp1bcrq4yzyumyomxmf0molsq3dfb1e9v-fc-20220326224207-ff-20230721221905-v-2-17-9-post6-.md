description: The ion momentum distribution in the x-ray-induced dissociative photoionization
  of molecules is investigated, treating the ionization analytically under the Born-Oppenheimer
  approximation and simulating numerically the ion motion via the Schrödinger equation.
  The ion-photoelectron entanglement transfers information of the electronic interference
  to the ion dynamics. As a consequence, the ion momentum distributions of dissociative
  molecular photoionization present Young's double-slit ...
