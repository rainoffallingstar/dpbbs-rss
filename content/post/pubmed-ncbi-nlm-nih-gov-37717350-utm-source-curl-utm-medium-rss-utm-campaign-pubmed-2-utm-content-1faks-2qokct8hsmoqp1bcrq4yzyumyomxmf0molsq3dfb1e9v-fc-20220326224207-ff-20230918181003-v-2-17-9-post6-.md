description: Psychomotor slowing (PS) is characterized by slowed movements and lower
  activity levels. PS is frequently observed in schizophrenia (SZ) and distressing
  because it impairs performance of everyday tasks and social activities. Studying
  brain topography contributing to PS in SZ can help to understand the underlying
  neurobiological mechanisms as well as help to develop more effective treatments
  that specifically target affected brain areas. Here, we conducted structural magnetic
  resonance ...
