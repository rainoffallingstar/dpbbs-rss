description: The term 'liquid biopsy' has become widely used by clinicians with the
  development of non-invasive diagnostic and monitoring techniques for malignancies.
  Liquid biopsy can provide genetic information for early diagnosis, risk stratification,
  treatment selection and postoperative follow-up. In the era of personalized medicine,
  liquid biopsy is an important research direction. In recent years, research on circulating
  tumour DNA (ctDNA) in hematological malignancies has also made great ...
