description: Here we describe highly compact, click compatible, and photoactivatable
  dyes for super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (nanoscopy). By combining the
  photoactivatable xanthone (PaX) core with a tetrazine group, we achieve minimally
  sized and highly sensitive molecular dyads for the selective labeling of unnatural
  amino acids introduced by genetic code expansion. We exploit the excited state quenching
  properties of the tetrazine group to attenuate the photoactivation rates of the
  PaX, ...
