  (DL). Existing Python packages for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data are not
  optimized for DL tasks. We therefore introduce pyM2aia, a Python package for MSI
  data analysis with a focus on memory-efficient handling, processing and convenient
  data-access for DL applications. pyM2aia provides interfaces to its parent application
  M2aia, which offers interactive capabilities for exploring and annotating MSI data
  in imzML ...'
