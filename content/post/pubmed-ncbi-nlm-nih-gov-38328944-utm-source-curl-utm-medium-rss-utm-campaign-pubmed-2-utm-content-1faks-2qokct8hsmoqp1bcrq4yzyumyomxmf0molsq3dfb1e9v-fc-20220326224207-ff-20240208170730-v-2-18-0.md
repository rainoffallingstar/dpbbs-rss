description: Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and toll-like receptors (TLRs) have
  been shown to independently modulate the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC). Since a direct cross-talk between these two signalling pathways in HCC has
  not been clearly described before, we aimed here to explore the possibility of such
  interaction. A human HCC tissue array (n = 20 vs. four control samples), human HCC
  samples (n = 10) and steatohepatitis-driven murine HCC samples (control, NASH and
  HCC; n ...
