description: In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a positive interim positron
  emission tomography (PET) scan predicts treatment failure, but the proportion of
  high-risk patients thus identified is small. To improve prediction, we combined
  the interim PET result with the presence or absence of an associated IgM gammopathy.
  Of 108 DLBCL patients participating in a prospective trial, nine (8%) were interim
  PET positive and 19 (18%) had an IgM gammopathy. The monoclonal protein was not
