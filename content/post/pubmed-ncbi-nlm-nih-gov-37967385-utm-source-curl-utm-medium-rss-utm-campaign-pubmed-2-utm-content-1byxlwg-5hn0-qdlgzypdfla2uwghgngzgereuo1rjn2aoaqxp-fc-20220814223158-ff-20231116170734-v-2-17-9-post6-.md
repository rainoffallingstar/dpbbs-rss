description: The detection of genetic aberrations is crucial for early therapy decisions
  in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is recommended for all patients. Since genetic
  testing is expensive and time-consuming, a need remains for cost-effective, fast,
  and broadly accessible tests to predict these aberrations in this aggressive malignancy.
  Here, we developed a novel fully automated end-to-end deep learning pipeline to
