description: Across multiancestry groups, we analyzed Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)
  associations in over 176,000 individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's
  disease (AD) versus controls. We demonstrate that the two diseases share the same
  protective association at the HLA locus. HLA-specific fine-mapping showed that hierarchical
  protective effects of HLA-DRB1*04 subtypes best accounted for the association, strongest
  with HLA-DRB1*04:04 and HLA-DRB1*04:07, and intermediary with ...
