description: CD19-negative relapse is a leading cause of treatment failure after Chimeric
  antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for ALL. We investigated a CAR T-cell product
  targeting CD19 and CD22 generated by lentiviral co-transduction with vectors encoding
  our previously-described fast-off rate CD19CAR (AUTO1) combined with a novel CD22CAR
  capable of effective signalling at low antigen density. Twelve patients with advanced
