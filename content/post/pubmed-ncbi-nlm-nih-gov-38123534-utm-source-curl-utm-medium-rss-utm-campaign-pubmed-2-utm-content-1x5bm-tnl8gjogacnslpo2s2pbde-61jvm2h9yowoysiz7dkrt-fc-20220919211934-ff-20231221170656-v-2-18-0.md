description: Single-cell technologies enable the dynamic analyses of cell fate mapping.
  However, capturing the gene regulatory relationships and identifying the driver
  factors that control cell fate decisions are still challenging. We present CEFCON,
  a network-based framework that first uses a graph neural network with attention
  mechanism to infer a cell-lineage-specific gene regulatory network (GRN) from single-cell
  RNA-sequencing data, and then models cell fate dynamics through network control
  theory ...
