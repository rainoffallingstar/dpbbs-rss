  treatment outcomes in lymphomas. We therefore tested the feasibility of a deep-learning
  (DL)-based image analysis methodology on pre-treatment diagnostic computed tomography
  (dCT), low-dose CT (lCT), and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
  (FDG-PET) images and rule-based reasoning to predict treatment response to chimeric
  antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in B-cell lymphomas. Pre-treatment images
