description: The acyl-CoA-binding domain-containing protein 6 (ACBD6) is ubiquitously
  expressed, plays a role in the acylation of lipids and proteins, and regulates the
  N-myristoylation of proteins via N-myristoyltransferase enzymes (NMTs). However,
  its precise function in cells is still unclear, as is the consequence of ACBD6 defects
  on human pathophysiology. Utilizing exome sequencing and extensive international
