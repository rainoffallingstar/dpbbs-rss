description: Molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium halides bearing a 2,2'-(^(i)Pr(2)As)(2)-substituted
  diphenylacetylene ([AsCCAs], 1-As) were prepared and reduced under an atmosphere
  of dinitrogen in order to activate the latter substrate. In the case of molybdenum,
  a diiodo (2-As) and a triiodo molybdenum precursor (5) were equally suited for reductive
  N(2) splitting, which led to the isolation of [AsCCAs]Mo≡N(I) (3-As) in each case.
  For tungsten, [AsCCAs]WCl(3) (6) was reduced under N(2) to ...
