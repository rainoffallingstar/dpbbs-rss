description: Arabidopsis microRNA165a (miR165a) targets Class III Homeodomain Leucine-Zipper
  (HD-ZIPIII) transcription factors to regulate various aspects of plant development
  and stress response. Over-expression of miR165a mimics the loss-of-function phenotype
  of HD-ZIPIII genes and leading to ectopic organ formation, shoot apical meristem
  (SAM) termination, loss of leaf polarity, and defective vasculature development.
  However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenotypes remain unresolved.
