description: Background Data on the use of the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator
  (WCD) among patients with myocarditis remain sparse. Consequently, evidence for
  guideline recommendations in this patient population is lacking. Methods and Results
  In total, 1596 consecutive patients were included in a multicenter registry from
  8 European centers, with 124 patients (8%) having received the WCD due to myocarditis
  and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction or prior ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
