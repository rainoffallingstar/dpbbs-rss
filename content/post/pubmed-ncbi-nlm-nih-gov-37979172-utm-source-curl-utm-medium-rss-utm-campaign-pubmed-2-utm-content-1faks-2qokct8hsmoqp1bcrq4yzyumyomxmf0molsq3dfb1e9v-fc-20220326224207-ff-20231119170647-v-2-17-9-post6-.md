description: Chromosome instability (CIN) contributes to resistance to therapies and
  tumor evolution. Although natural killer (NK) cells can eliminate cells with complex
  karyotypes, high-CIN human tumors have an immunosuppressive phenotype. To understand
  which CIN-associated molecular features alter immune recognition during tumor evolution,
  we overexpress Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in a Her2^(+) breast cancer model. These
  high-CIN tumors activate a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), ...
