description: Serotonin (5-HT) is a vital modulatory neurotransmitter responsible for
  regulating most behaviors in the brain. An inefficient 5-HT synaptic function is
  often linked to various mental disorders. Primarily, membrane proteins controlling
  the expression and activity of 5-HT synthesis, storage, release, receptor activation,
  and inactivation are critical to 5-HT signaling in synaptic and extra-synaptic sites.
  Moreover, these signals represent information transmission across membranes. Although
