description: We performed a retrospective analysis on 124 patients with transfusion-dependent
  thalassemia who were registered in the German pediatric registry for stem cell transplantation.
  All patients underwent first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) between 2011 and 2020 and belonged mainly to Pesaro risk class 1-2. Four-year
  overall (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS) were 94.5% ± 2.9% and 88.0% ± 3.4%
  after treosulfan-fludarabine-thiotepa- and 96.9% ± 3.1% (P = 0.763) ...
