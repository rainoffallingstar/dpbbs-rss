description: Myasthenic crisis (MC) requiring mechanical ventilation is a serious
  complication of myasthenia gravis (MG). Here we analyze the frequency and risk factors
  of weaning- and extubation failure as well as its impact on the clinical course
  in a large cohort. We performed a retrospective chart review on patients treated
  for MC in 12 German neurological departments between 2006 and 2015. Weaning failure
  (WF) was defined as negative spontaneous breathing trial, primary tracheostomy,
