description: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) defines a premalignant state predominantly
  found in older persons that increases the risk of developing hematologic malignancies
  and age-related inflammatory diseases. However, the risk for malignant transformation
  or non-malignant disorders is variable and difficult to predict, and defining the
  clinical relevance of specific candidate driver mutations in individual carriers
  has proved to be challenging. In addition to the cell-intrinsic mechanisms, mutant
  cells rely ...
