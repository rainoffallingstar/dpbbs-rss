description: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous malignancy of plasma cells.
  Despite improvement in the prognosis of MM patients after the introduction of many
  new drugs in the past decades, MM remains incurable since most patients become treatment-resistant.
  Cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is activated in many types of cancer and has been
  associated with drug resistance in MM. However, its association with disease stage,
  genetic alterations, and outcome has not been systematically investigated ...
