description: African trypanosomes colonise the skin to ensure parasite transmission.
  However, how the skin responds to trypanosome infection remains unresolved. Here,
  we investigate the local immune response of the skin in a murine model of infection
  using spatial and single cell transcriptomics. We detect expansion of dermal IL-17A-producing
  Vγ6^(+) cells during infection, which occurs in the subcutaneous adipose tissue.
  In silico cell-cell communication analysis suggests that subcutaneous ...
