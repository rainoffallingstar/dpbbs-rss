  the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene T790M mutation,
  which is the most frequent resistance alteration in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
  after treatment with the first-/second-generation (1G/2G) EGFR inhibitors (tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors [TKIs]), but only weakly associated with clinical characteristics.
  Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on pretreatment tumor tissue with matched
