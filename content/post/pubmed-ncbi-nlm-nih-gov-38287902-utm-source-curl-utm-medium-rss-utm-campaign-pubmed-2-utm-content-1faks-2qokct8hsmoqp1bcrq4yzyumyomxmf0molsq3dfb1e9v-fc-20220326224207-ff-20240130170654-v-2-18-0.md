description: Iron, as an essential micronutrient, plays a crucial role in host-pathogen
  interactions. In order to limit the growth of the pathogen, a common strategy of
  innate immunity includes withdrawing available iron to interfere with the cellular
  processes of the microorganism. Against that, unicellular parasites have developed
  powerful strategies to scavenge iron, despite the effort of the host. Iron-sequestering
  compounds, such as the approved and potent chelator deferoxamine (DFO), are considered
