description: Individuals living with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience severe recurrent
  acute and chronic pain. Challenges to gaining mechanistic insight into pathogenic
  SCD pain processes include differential gene expression and function of sensory
  neurons between humans and mice with SCD, and extremely limited availability of
  neuronal tissues from SCD patients. Here we used SCD patient-derived induced pluripotent
  stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into sensory neurons (SCD iSNs) to begin to ...
