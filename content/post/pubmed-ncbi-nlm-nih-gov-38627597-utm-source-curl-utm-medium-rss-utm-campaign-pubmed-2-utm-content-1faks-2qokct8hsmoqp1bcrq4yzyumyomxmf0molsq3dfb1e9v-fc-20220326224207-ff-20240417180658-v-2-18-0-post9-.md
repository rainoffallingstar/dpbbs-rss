description: How chronic mutational processes and punctuated bursts of DNA damage
  drive evolution of the cancer genome is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate
  a strategy to disentangle and quantify distinct mechanisms underlying genome evolution
  in single cells, during single mitoses and at single-strand resolution. To distinguish
  between chronic (reactive oxygen species (ROS)) and acute (ultraviolet light (UV))
  mutagenesis, we microfluidically separate pairs of sister cells from the first ...
