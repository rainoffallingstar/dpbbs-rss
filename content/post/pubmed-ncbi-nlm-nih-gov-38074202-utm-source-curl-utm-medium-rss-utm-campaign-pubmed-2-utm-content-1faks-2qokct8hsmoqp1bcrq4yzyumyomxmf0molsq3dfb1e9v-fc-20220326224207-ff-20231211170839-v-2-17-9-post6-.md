description: We present a unique case of a 44-year-old woman who presented at 29 weeks'
  gestation with proximal limb pain and elevated creatine kinase. This occurred in
  the background of premature cataracts, atrial fibrillation and abnormal liver function.
  Clinical, pathological and neurodiagnostic findings supported a diagnosis of myotonic
  dystrophy, confirmed by genetic testing which revealed dystrophia myotonica protein
  kinase gene expansion. Muscle biopsy found both recent necrotising and ...
