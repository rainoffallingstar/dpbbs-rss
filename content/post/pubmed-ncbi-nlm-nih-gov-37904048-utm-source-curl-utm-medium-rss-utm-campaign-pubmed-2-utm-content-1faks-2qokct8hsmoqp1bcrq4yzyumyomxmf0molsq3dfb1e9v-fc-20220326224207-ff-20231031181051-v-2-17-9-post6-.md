description: Medicinal chemistry has discovered thousands of potent protein and lipid
  kinase inhibitors. These may be developed into therapeutic drugs or chemical probes
  to study kinase biology. Because of polypharmacology, a large part of the human
  kinome currently lacks selective chemical probes. To discover such probes, we profiled
  1,183 compounds from drug discovery projects in lysates of cancer cell lines using
  Kinobeads. The resulting 500,000 compound-target interactions are available in ...
