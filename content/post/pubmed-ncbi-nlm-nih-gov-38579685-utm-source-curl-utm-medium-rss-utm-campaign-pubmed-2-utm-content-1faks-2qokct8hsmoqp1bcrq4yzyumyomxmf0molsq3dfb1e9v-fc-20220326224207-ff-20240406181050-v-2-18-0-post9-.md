description: The YAP/Hippo pathway is an organ growth and size regulation rheostat
  safeguarding multiple tissue stem cell compartments. LATS kinases phosphorylate
  and thereby inactivate YAP, thus representing a potential direct drug target for
  promoting tissue regeneration. Here, we report the identification and characterization
  of the selective small-molecule LATS kinase inhibitor NIBR-LTSi. NIBR-LTSi activates
  YAP signaling, shows good oral bioavailability, and expands organoids derived from
