description: Targeted modifications of the human epigenome, epigenome editing (EE),
  are around the corner. For EE, techniques similar to genome editing (GE) techniques
  are used. While in GE the genetic information is changed by directly modifying DNA,
  intervening in the epigenome requires modifying the configuration of DNA, for example,
  how it is folded. This does not come with alterations in the base sequence ('genetic
  code'). To date, there is almost no ethical debate about EE, whereas the ...
