description: It has been suggested that the novel selective phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9)
  inhibitor may improve cardiac and renal function by blocking 3',5'-cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate (cGMP) degradation. 5/6 nephrectomized (5/6Nx) rats were used to investigate
  the effects of the PDE9 inhibitor (BAY 73-6691) on the heart and kidney. Two doses
  of BAY 73-6691 (1 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day) were given for 95 days. The 5/6Nx rats
  developed albuminuria, a decrease in serum creatinine clearance (Ccr), and ...
