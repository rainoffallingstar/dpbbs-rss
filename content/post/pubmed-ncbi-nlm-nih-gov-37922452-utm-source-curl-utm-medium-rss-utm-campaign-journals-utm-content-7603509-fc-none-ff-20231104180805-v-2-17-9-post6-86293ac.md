description: Acute leukemia cells require bone marrow microenvironments, termed niches,
  which provide leukemic cells with niche factors that are essential for leukemic
  cell survival and/or proliferation. However, it remains unclear how the dynamics
  of the leukemic cell-niche interaction are regulated. Using a genome-wide CRISPR
  screen, we discovered that canonical BRG1/BRM-associated factor (cBAF), a variant
