description: The phase 3 ZUMA-7 trial in second-line large B cell lymphoma demonstrated
  superiority of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy (axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel))
  over standard of care (SOC; salvage chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic transplantation)
  ( NCT03391466 ). Here, we present a prespecified exploratory analysis examining
  the association between pretreatment tumor characteristics and the efficacy of axi-cel
  versus SOC. B cell gene expression signature (GES) and CD19 expression ...
