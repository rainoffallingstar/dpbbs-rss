description: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) of the lower back is considered
  a surrogate for acute low back pain (aLBP) in experimental studies. Of note, it
  is often unquestioningly assumed to be muscle pain. To date, there has not been
  a study analyzing lumbar DOMS in terms of its pain origin, which was the aim of
  this study. Sixteen healthy individuals (L-DOMS) were enrolled for the present study
  and matched to participants from a previous study (n = 16, L-PAIN) who had undergone
