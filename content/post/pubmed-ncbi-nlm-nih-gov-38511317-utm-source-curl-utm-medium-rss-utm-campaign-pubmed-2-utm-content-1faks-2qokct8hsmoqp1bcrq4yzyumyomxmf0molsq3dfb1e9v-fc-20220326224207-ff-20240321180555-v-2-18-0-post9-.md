description: Inflammatory responses in small vessels play an important role in the
  development of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, stroke, and small
  vessel disease. This involves various complex molecular processes including oxidative
  stress, inflammasome activation, immune-mediated responses, and protein misfolding,
  which together contribute to microvascular damage. In addition, epigenetic factors,
  including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs influence ...
