description: The observation of neutrinoless double-beta (0νββ) decay would offer
  proof of lepton number violation, demonstrating that neutrinos are Majorana particles,
  while also helping us understand why there is more matter than antimatter in the
  Universe. If the decay is driven by the exchange of the three known light neutrinos,
  a discovery would, in addition, link the observed decay rate to the neutrino mass
  scale through a theoretical quantity known as the nuclear matrix element (NME).
