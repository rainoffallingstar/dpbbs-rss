description: Endometrial cancer (EC) is one of the most common female cancers and
  there is currently no routine screening strategy for early detection. An altered
  abundance of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) and other RNA classes have the potential
  as early cancer biomarkers. We analyzed circulating RNA levels using small RNA sequencing,
  targeting RNAs in the size range of 17-47 nucleotides, in EC patients with samples
  collected prior to diagnosis compared to cancer-free controls. The analysis included
