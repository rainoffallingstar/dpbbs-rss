description: Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a well-established model for studying the
  nervous system. Findings in zebrafish often inform studies on human diseases of
  the nervous system and provide crucial insight into disease mechanisms. The functions
  of the nervous system often rely on communication between neurons. Signal transduction
  is achieved via release of signaling molecules in the form of neuropeptides or neurotransmitters
  at synapses. Snapshots of membrane dynamics of these processes are imaged ...
