description: Gouty arthritis is one of the most common metabolic disorders affecting
  people. Plant based drugs can lower the risk of this health disorder. The anti-gouty
  potential of Eucalyptus torquata flowers methanol extract (ETME) was evaluated in
  vitro via measuring the inhibitory effects of five pro-inflammatory enzymes; xanthine
  oxidase (XO), hyaluronidase, lipoxygenase (5-LOX), cyclooxygenases COX-1, and COX-2,
  in addition to evaluating the inhibition of histamine release, albumin ...
