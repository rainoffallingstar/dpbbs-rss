description: Autotaxin (ATX) contributes to the production of lysophosphatidic acid
  (LPA), which is associated with fibrosis development in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
  (IPF). The ATX inhibitor, ziritaxestat, failed to reduce decline in forced vital
  capacity (FVC) in patients with IPF in ISABELA 1 and 2 (NCT03711162; NCT03733444),
  two identically designed Phase 3 studies. In the current analysis, we evaluated
  pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from the pooled ISABELA studies to determine
