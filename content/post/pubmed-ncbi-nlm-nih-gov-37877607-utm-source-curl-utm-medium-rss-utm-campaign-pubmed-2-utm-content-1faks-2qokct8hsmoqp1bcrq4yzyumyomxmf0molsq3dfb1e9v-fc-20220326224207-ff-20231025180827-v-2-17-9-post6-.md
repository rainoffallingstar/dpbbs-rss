description: A series of structurally constrained phosphenium ions based on pyridinylmethylamidophenolate
  scaffolds are shown to undergo P(III)/P(V) oxidative addition with C-H bonds of
  alkynes, alkenes, and arenes. Nonactivated substrates such as benzene, toluene,
  and deactivated chlorobenzene are phosphorylated in quantitative yields. Computational
  and spectroscopic studies suggest a low-barrier isomerization from a bent to a T-shaped
  isomer that initiates a phosphorus-ligand-cooperative pathway ...
