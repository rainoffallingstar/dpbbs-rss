description: Specific signalling thresholds of the WNT/β-catenin pathway affect embryogenesis
  and tissue homeostasis in the adult, with mutations in this pathway frequently occurring
  in cancer. Excessive WNT/β-catenin activity inhibits murine anterior development
  associated with embryonic lethality and accounts for the driver event in 80% of
  human colorectal cancers. Uncontrolled WNT/β-catenin signalling arises primarily
  from impairment mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC that otherwise ...
