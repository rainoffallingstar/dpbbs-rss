description: The photooxidative stability of a series of doubly bridged anthracenes
  was evaluated after their preparation via twofold macrocyclization of a bis(resorcinyl)anthracene.
  Lightfastness correlates with the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular
  orbital (HOMO), resulting in superior stability of the tetraesters compared to the
  tetraethers. The lengths and steric demand of the linker only plays a minor role
  for the ester-based compounds, which can be prepared in reasonable yields and ...
