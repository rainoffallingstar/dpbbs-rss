description: Sclerosing skeletal dysplasias result from an imbalance between bone
  formation and resorption. We identified three homozygous, C-terminally truncating
  AXIN1 variants in seven individuals from four families affected by macrocephaly,
  cranial hyperostosis, and vertebral endplate sclerosis. Other frequent findings
  included hip dysplasia, heart malformations, variable developmental delay, and hematological
  anomalies. In line with AXIN1 being a central component of the β-catenin destruction
