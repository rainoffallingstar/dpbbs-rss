description: Spatial omics has emerged as a rapidly growing and fruitful field with
  hundreds of publications presenting novel methods for obtaining spatially resolved
  information for any omics data type on spatial scales ranging from subcellular to
  organismal. From a technology development perspective, spatial omics is a highly
  interdisciplinary field that integrates imaging and omics, spatial and molecular
  analyses, sequencing and mass spectrometry, and image analysis and bioinformatics.
