description: We developed a simple screening system for the evaluation of neuromuscular
  and general toxicity in zebrafish embryos. The modular system consists of electrodynamic
  transducers above which tissue culture dishes with embryos can be placed. Multiple
  such loudspeaker-tissue culture dish pairs can be combined. Vibrational stimuli
  generated by the electrodynamic transducers induce a characteristic startle and
  escape response in the embryos. A belt-driven linear drive sequentially positions
