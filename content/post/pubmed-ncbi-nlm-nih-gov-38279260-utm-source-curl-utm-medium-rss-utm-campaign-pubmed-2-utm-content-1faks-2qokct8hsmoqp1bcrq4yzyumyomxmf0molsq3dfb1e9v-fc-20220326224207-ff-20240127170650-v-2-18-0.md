description: Donation after circulatory death (DCD) hearts are predominantly maintained
  by normothermic blood perfusion (NBP). Nevertheless, it was shown that hypothermic
  crystalloid perfusion (HCP) is superior to blood perfusion to recondition left ventricular
  (LV) contractility. However, transcriptomic changes in the myocardium and coronary
  artery in DCD hearts after HCP and NBP have not been investigated yet. In a pig
  model, DCD hearts were harvested and maintained for 4 h by NBP (DCD-BP group, N
  = 8) ...
