description: This work presents systematic comparisons between classical molecular
  dynamics (cMD) and quantum dynamics (QD) simulations of 15-dimensional and 75-dimensional
  models in their description of H atom scattering from graphene. We use an experimentally
  validated full-dimensional neural network potential energy surface of a hydrogen
  atom interacting with a large cell of graphene containing 24 carbon atoms. For quantum
  dynamics simulations, we apply Monte Carlo canonical polyadic decomposition ...
