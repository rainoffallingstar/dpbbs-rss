description: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I peptide ligands (HLAIps) are key
  targets for developing vaccines and immunotherapies against infectious pathogens
  or cancer cells. Identifying HLAIps is challenging due to their high diversity,
  low abundance, and patient individuality. Here, we develop a highly sensitive method
  for identifying HLAIps using liquid chromatography-ion mobility-tandem mass spectrometry
  (LC-IMS-MS/MS). In addition, we train a timsTOF-specific peak intensity MS²PIP model
