description: Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab
  (FCR) achieves durable remissions, with flattening of the progression-free survival
  (PFS) curve in patients with mutated IGHV gene (IGHV-M). We updated long-term follow-up
  results from the original 300 patient FCR study initiated at M.D. Anderson in 1999.
  Current median follow-up is 19.0 years. With this extended follow-up, the median
  PFS for patients with IGHV-M was 14.6 years vs 4.2 years for patients with unmutated
