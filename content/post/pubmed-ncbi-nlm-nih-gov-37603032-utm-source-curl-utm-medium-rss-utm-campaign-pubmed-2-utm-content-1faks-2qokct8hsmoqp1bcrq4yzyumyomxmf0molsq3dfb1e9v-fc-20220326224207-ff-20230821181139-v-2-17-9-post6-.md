description: There is a clinical need for early detection of chronic kidney disease
  (CKD) in patients with organic acidurias. We measured kidney markers in a longitudinal
  study over 5 years in 40 patients with methylmalonic aciduria (Mut⁰ ), propionic
  aciduria (PA), cobalamin A (CblA) and cobalamin C (CblC) deficiencies. Neutrophil
  gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), calprotectin (CLP), kidney injury molecule-1
