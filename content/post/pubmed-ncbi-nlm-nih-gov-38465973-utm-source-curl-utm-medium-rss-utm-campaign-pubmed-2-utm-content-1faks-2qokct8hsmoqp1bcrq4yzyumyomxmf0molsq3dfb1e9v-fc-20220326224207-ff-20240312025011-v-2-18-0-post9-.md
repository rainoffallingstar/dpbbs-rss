description: Glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP-1R) agonists (e.g., semaglutide,
  liraglutide, etc.) are efficient treatment options for people with type 2 diabetes
  and obesity. The manufacturing method to produce semaglutide, a blockbuster GLP-1
  drug on the market, involves multistep synthesis. The large peptide has a hydrophobic
  fatty acid side chain that makes it sparingly soluble, and its handling, purification,
  and large-scale production difficult. The growing demand for semaglutide that ...
