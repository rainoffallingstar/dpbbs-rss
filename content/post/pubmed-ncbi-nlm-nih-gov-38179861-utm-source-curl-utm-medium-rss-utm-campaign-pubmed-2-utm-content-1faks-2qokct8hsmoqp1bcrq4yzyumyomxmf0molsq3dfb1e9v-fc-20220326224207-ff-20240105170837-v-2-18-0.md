description: The 1,4-dithiin motif is known for its reversible redox properties to
  generate radical cations and diradical dications and thus is interesting for organic
  electronic applications. However, examples where this motif is embedded into chiral
  larger fused aromatic compounds is very rare. Here we describe the syntheses of
  several structurally related pyrene fused dithiins and their spectroscopic investigations
  with a focus on tuning circular dichroism in respect the g values depending on ...
