description: In this work, we propose a processing pipeline for the extraction and
  identification of meaningful radiomics biomarkers in skeletal muscle tissue as displayed
  using Dixon-weighted MRI. Diverse and robust radiomics features can be identified
  that may be of aid in the accurate quantification e.g. varying degrees of sarcopenia
  in respective muscles of large cohorts. As such, the approach comprises the texture
  feature extraction from raw data based on well established approaches, such as a
