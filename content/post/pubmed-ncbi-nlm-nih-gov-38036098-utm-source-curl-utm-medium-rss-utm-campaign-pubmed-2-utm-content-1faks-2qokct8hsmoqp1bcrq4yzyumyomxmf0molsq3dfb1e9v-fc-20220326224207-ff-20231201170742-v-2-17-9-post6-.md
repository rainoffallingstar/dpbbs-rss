description: Endogenous peptide inhibitor for CXCR4 (EPI-X4) is a CXCR4 antagonist
  with potential for cancer therapy. It is a processed fragment of serum albumin from
  the hemofiltrate of dialysis patients. This study reports the efficacy of fifteen
  EPI-X4 derivatives in pancreatic cancer and lymphoma models. In vitro, the peptides
  were investigated for antiproliferation (cytotoxicity) by MTT assay. The mRNA expression
  for CXCR4 and CXCL12 was determined by RT-PCR, chip array and RNA sequencing. Chip
