description: Screening for Lynch syndrome (LS) in colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial
  cancer (EC) patients generally involves immunohistochemical staining of the mismatch
  repair (MMR) proteins. In case of MLH1 protein loss, MLH1 promotor hypermethylation
  (MLH1-PM) testing is performed to indirectly distinguish constitutional MLH1 variants
  from somatic epimutations. However, in recent years a growing number of studies
  have reported that MLH1-PM and pathogenic constitutional MMR variants are not ...
