description: Photosymbiotic cnidarians generally seek bright environments so that
  their symbionts can be photosynthetically active. However, excess light may result
  in a breakdown of symbiosis due to the accumulation of photodamage in symbionts
  causing symbiont loss (bleaching). It is currently unknown if photosymbiotic cnidarians
  sense light only to regulate spawning time and to facilitate predation, or whether
  they also use their light-sensing capacities to protect their symbionts from photodamage.
