description: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful experimental setting
  for uncovering fundamental tenets of nervous system organization and function. Its
  nearly invariant and simple anatomy, coupled with a plethora of methodologies for
  interrogating single-gene functions at single-cell resolution in vivo, have led
  to exciting discoveries in glial cell biology and mechanisms of glia-neuron interactions.
  Findings over the last two decades reinforce the idea that insights from C. elegans
  can ...
