description: We calculate resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra of pyrazine
  at the nitrogen K-edge in the time domain including wavepacket dynamics in both
  the valence and core-excited state manifolds. Upon resonant excitation, we observe
  ultrafast non-adiabatic population transfer between core-excited states within the
  core-hole lifetime, leading to molecular symmetry distortions. Importantly, our
  time-domain approach inherently contains the ability to manipulate the dynamics
  of this process ...
