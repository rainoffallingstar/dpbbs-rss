description: Preeclampsia is a major hypertensive pregnancy disorder with a 50% heritability.
  The first identified gene involved in the disease is STOX1, a transcription factor,
  whose variant Y153H predisposes to the disease. Two rare mutations were also identified
  in Colombian women affected by the hemolysis, elevated liver enzyme, low platelet
  syndrome, a complication of preeclampsia (T188N and R364X). Here, we explore the
  effects of these variants in trophoblast cell models (BeWo) where STOX1 ...
