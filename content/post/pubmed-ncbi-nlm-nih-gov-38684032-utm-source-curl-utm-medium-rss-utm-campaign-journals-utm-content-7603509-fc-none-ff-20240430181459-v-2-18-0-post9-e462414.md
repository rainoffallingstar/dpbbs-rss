description: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by the ability to self-renew
  and to replenish the hematopoietic system. The cell-cycle kinase cyclin dependent-kinase
  6 (CDK6) regulates transcription, whereby it has both kinase-dependent and kinase-independent
  functions. We here describe the complex role of CDK6, balancing quiescence, proliferation,
  self-renewal and differentiation in activated HSCs. Mouse HSCs expressing kinase-inactivated
  CDK6 show enhanced long-term repopulation and ...
