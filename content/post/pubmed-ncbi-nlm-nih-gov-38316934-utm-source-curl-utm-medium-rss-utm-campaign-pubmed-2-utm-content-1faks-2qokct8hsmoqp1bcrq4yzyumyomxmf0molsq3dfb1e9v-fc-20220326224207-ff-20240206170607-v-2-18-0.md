description: Human intestinal epithelial cells are the interface between luminal content
  and basally residing immune cells. They form a tight monolayer that constantly secretes
  mucus creating a multilayered protective barrier. Alterations in this barrier can
  lead to increased permeability which is common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  patients. However, it remains unexplored how the barrier is affected. Here, we present
