description: Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that has received considerable attention
  not only as a means to eradicate defined tumour entities but also because it provides
  unforeseen insights into the metabolic adaptation that tumours exploit to counteract
  phospholipid oxidation^(1,2). Here, we identify proferroptotic activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase (DHCR7) and an unexpected prosurvival function of its substrate, 7-dehydrocholesterol
  (7-DHC). Although previous studies suggested that ...
