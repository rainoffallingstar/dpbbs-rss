description: The volume of oxygen drawn from systemic capillaries down a partial pressure
  gradient is determined by the oxygen content of red blood cells (RBCs) and their
  oxygen-unloading kinetics, although the latter is assumed to be rapid and, therefore,
  not a meaningful factor. Under this paradigm, oxygen transfer to tissues is perfusion-limited.
  Consequently, clinical treatments to optimize oxygen delivery aim at improving blood
  flow and arterial oxygen content, rather than RBC oxygen-handling. ...
