description: Although it is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the -globin
  gene, sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a systemic disease with complex, incompletely
  elucidated pathologies. The mononuclear phagocyte system plays critical roles in
  SCA pathophysiology. However, how heterogeneous populations of hepatic macrophages
  contribute to SCA remains unclear. Using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing
  and spatial transcriptomics via multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ ...
