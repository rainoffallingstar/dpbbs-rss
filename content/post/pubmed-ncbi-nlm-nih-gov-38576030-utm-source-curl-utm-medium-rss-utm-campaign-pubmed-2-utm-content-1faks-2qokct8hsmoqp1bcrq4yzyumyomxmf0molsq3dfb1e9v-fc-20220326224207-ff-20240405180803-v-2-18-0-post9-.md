description: DNA methylation analysis based on supervised machine learning algorithms
  with static reference data, allowing diagnostic tumour typing with unprecedented
  precision, has quickly become a new standard of care. Whereas genome-wide diagnostic
  methylation profiling is mostly performed on microarrays, an increasing number of
  institutions additionally employ nanopore sequencing as a faster alternative. In
  addition, methylation-specific parallel sequencing can generate methylation and
  genomic ...
