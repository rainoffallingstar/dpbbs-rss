  chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. To facilitate patient accessibility,
  short-term (st) CAR T cells, which are administered to patients only 24 h after
  vector exposure, are in focus of current investigations. Their impact on the incidence
  and severity of CRS has been poorly explored. Here, we evaluated CD19-specific stCAR
