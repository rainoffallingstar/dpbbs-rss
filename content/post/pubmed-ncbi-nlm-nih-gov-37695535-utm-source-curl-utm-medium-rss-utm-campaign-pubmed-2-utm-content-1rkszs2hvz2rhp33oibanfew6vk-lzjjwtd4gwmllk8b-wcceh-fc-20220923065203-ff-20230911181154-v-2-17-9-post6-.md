description: Monocytes positive for 6-Sulfo LacNAc (slan) are a major subset of non-classical
  CD14dimCD16+ monocytes in humans. We have shown that slan+ cells infiltrate lymphomas
  and elicit an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of neoplastic B cells
  mediated by the anti-CD20 therapeutic Rituximab. Herein, by performing blocking
  experiments and flow cytometry analyses, as well as confocal microscopy and live-cell
  imaging assays, we extended the findings to other humanized antibodies ...
