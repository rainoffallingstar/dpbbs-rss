description: The eukaryotic guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) pathway mediates
  the biogenesis of tail-anchored (TA) membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum.
  In the cytosol, the Get3 chaperone captures the TA protein substrate and delivers
  it to the Get1/Get2 membrane protein complex (GET insertase), which then inserts
  the substrate via a membrane-embedded hydrophilic groove. Here, we present structures,
  atomistic simulations and functional data of human and Chaetomium ...
