description: RNA pol II assembly occurs in the cytoplasm before translocation of the
  enzyme to the nucleus. Affecting this assembly influences mRNA transcription in
  the nucleus and mRNA decay in the cytoplasm. However, very little is known about
  the consequences on ncRNA synthesis. In this work, we show that impairment of RNA
  pol II assembly leads to a decrease in cryptic non-coding RNAs (preferentially CUTs
  and SUTs). This alteration is partially restored upon overcoming the assembly defect.
