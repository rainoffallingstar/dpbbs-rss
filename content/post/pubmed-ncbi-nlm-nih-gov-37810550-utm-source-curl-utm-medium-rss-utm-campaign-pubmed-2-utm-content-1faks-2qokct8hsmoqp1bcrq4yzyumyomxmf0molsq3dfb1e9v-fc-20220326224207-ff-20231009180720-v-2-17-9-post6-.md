description: Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1), encoded at the MECOM locus,
  is an oncogenic zinc finger transcription factor with diverse roles in normal and
  malignant cells, most extensively studied in the context of hematopoiesis. EVI1
  interacts with other transcription factors in a context-dependent manner and regulates
  transcription and chromatin remodeling, thereby influencing the proliferation, differentiation,
  and survival of cells. Interestingly, it can act both as a transcriptional ...
