description: The transcriptional antisilencer VirB acts as a master regulator of virulence
  gene expression in the human pathogen Shigella flexneri. It binds DNA sequences
  (virS) upstream of VirB-dependent promoters and counteracts their silencing by the
  nucleoid-organizing protein H-NS. However, its precise mode of action remains unclear.
  Notably, VirB is not a classical transcription factor but related to ParB-type DNA-partitioning
  proteins, which have recently been recognized as DNA-sliding clamps ...
