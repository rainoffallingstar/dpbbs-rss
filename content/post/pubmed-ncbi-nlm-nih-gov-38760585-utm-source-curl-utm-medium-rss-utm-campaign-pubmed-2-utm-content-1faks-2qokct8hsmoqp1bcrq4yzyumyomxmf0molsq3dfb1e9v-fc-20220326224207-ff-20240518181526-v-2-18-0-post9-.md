description: Neural-tumor interactions drive glioma growth as evidenced in preclinical
  models, but clinical validation is limited. We present an epigenetically defined
  neural signature of glioblastoma that independently predicts patients' survival.
  We use reference signatures of neural cells to deconvolve tumor DNA and classify
  samples into low- or high-neural tumors. High-neural glioblastomas exhibit hypomethylated
  CpG sites and upregulation of genes associated with synaptic integration. ...
