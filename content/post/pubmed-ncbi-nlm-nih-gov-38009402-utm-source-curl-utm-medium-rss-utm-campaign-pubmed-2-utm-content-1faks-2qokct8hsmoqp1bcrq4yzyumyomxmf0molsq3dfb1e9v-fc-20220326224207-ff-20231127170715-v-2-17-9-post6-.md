description: Plasmodium sporozoite development in and egress from oocysts in the Anopheles
  mosquito remains largely enigmatic. In a previously performed high-throughput knockout
  screen, the putative subunit 5 of the prefoldin complex (PbPCS5, PBANKA_0920100)
  was identified as essential for parasite development during mosquito and liver stage
  development. Here we generated and analyzed a PbPCS5 knockout parasite line during
  its development in the mosquito. Interestingly, PbPCS5 deletion does not ...
