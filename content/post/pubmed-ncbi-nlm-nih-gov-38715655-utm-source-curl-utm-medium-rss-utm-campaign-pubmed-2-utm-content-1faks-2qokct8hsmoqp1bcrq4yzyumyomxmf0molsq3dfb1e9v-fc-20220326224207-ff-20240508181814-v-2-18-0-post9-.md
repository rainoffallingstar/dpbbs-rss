description: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pathogenic variants in GRIN2A are associated
  with a spectrum of epilepsy-aphasia syndromes (EASs). Seizures as well as speech
  and language disorders occur frequently but vary widely in severity, both between
  individuals and across the life span. The link between this phenotypic spectrum
  and brain characteristics is unknown. Specifically, altered brain networks at the
  root of speech and language deficits remain to be identified. Patients with pathogenic
