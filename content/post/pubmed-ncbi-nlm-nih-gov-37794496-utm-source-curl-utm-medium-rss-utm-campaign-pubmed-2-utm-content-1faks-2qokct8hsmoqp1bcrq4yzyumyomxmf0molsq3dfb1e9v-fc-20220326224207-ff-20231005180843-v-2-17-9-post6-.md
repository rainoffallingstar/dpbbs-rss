description: The spatial distribution of mosquito species in the course of globalization
  and climate warming is highly dynamic. Different studies have demonstrated the spread
  and establishment of thermophilic mosquito species, potentially increasing the prevalence
  of 'nuisance' mosquitoes and the local transmission of pathogens. Here we report
  the first recorded sampling of Anopheles hyrcanus in Wrocław, southwest Poland.
  This is the most northern detection of this species to date in Europe. Future ...
