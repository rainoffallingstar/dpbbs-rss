description: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for the diagnostic
  classification and risk stratification in most patients with cardiac disorders.
  The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of Strain-encoded MR
  (SENC) for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). A systematic
  review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA Guidelines, including
  patients with or without cardiovascular disease and asymptomatic individuals. Myocardial
