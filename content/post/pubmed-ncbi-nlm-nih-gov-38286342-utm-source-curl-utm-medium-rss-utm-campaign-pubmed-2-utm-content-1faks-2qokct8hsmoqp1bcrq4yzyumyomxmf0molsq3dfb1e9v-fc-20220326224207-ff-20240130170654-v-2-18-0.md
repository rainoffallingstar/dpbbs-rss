description: Tight relationships exist in the local universe between the central stellar
  properties of galaxies and the mass of their supermassive black hole^(1,2,3). These
  suggest galaxies and black holes co-evolve, with the main regulation mechanism being
  energetic feedback from accretion onto the black hole during its quasar phase^(4,5,6).
  A crucial question is how the relationship between black holes and galaxies evolves
  with time; a key epoch to probe this relationship is at the peaks of star ...
