description: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder in which the
  MYC oncogene is frequently dysregulated. Due to its central role, MYC has been proposed
  as a drug target; however, the development of a clinically applicable molecule modulating
  MYC activity remains an unmet challenge. Consequently, an alternative is the development
  of therapeutic options targeting proteins located downstream of MYC. Therefore,
  we aimed to identify undescribed MYC-target proteins in MM cells using ...
