description: Dietary lipids can affect metabolic health through gut microbiota-mediated
  mechanisms, but the influence of lipid-microbiota interaction on liver steatosis
  is largely unknown. We investigate the impact of dietary lipids on human gut microbiota
  composition and the effects of microbiota-lipid interactions on steatosis in male
  mice. In humans, low intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) is associated with increased
  microbial diversity independent of fiber intake. In mice, poorly absorbed ...
