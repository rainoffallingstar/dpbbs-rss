description: Relapse of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly aggressive and often
  treatment refractory. We analyzed previously published AML relapse cohorts and found
  that 40% of relapses occur without changes in driver mutations, suggesting that
  non-genetic mechanisms drive relapse in a large proportion of cases. We therefore
  characterized epigenetic patterns of AML relapse using 26 matched diagnosis-relapse
  samples with ATAC-seq. This analysis identified a relapse-specific chromatin ...
