description: Tissue engineering (TE) techniques offer solutions for tissue regeneration
  but require large quantities of cells. For microtia patients, TE methods represent
  a unique opportunity for therapies with low donor-site morbidity and reliance on
  the surgeon's individual expertise. Microtia-derived chondrocytes and perichondrocytes
  are considered a valuable cell source for autologous reconstruction of the pinna.
