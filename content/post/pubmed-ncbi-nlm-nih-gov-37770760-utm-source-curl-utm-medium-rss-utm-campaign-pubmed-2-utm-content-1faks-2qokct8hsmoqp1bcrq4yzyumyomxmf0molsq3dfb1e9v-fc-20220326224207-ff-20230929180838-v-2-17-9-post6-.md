description: Drug combinations can expand options for antibacterial therapies but
  have not been systematically tested in Gram-positive species. We profiled ~8,000
  combinations of 65 antibacterial drugs against the model species Bacillus subtilis
  and two prominent pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
  Thereby, we recapitulated previously known drug interactions, but also identified
  ten times more novel interactions in the pathogen S. aureus, including 150 synergies.
  We showed that ...
