description: Underactive bladder (UAB) is essentially an inability of the bladder
  to properly empty. UAB symptoms, when they co-occur with posterior fornix syndrome
  (PFS) symptoms (urge, frequency, nocturia, chronic pelvic pain), can be cured/improved,
  surgically by uterosacral ligament (USL) repair, non-surgically, by devices which
  give mechanical support of the USLs or strengthening pelvic muscle and ligaments
  with squatting-based exercises. The pathogenic pathway from weak USLs to UAB (and
  PFS) is ...
