description: Transglutaminase factor (F)XIII is essential for hemostasis, wound healing,
  and pregnancy maintenance. Plasma FXIII is composed of A and B subunit dimers synthesized
  in cells of hematopoietic origin and hepatocytes, respectively. The subunits associate
  tightly in circulation as FXIII-A2B2. FXIII-B2 stabilizes the (pro)active site-containing
  FXIII-A subunits. Interestingly, people with genetic FXIII-A deficiency have decreased
  FXIII-B2, and therapeutic infusion of recombinant FXIII-A2 ...
