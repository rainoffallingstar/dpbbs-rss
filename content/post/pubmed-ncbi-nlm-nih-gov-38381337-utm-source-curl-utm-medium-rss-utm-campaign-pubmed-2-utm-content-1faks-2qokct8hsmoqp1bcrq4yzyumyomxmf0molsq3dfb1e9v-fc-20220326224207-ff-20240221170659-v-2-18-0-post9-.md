description: In the past years, circular RNAs (circRNAs) became a major focus of many
  studies in animals and plants. circRNAs are generated by backsplicing from the same
  linear transcripts that are canonically spliced to produce, for example, mature
  mRNAs. They exhibit tissue-specific expression pattern and are potentially involved
  in many diseases, among them cardiovascular diseases. However, despite the tremendous
  efforts to establish circRNA catalogues, much less is known about the biological
  function ...
