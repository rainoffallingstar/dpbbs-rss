description: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is preceded by monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis
  (MBL), a potential CLL precursor state which can be detected in up to 17% in aged
  individuals. Recently, we described significant B-cell receptor immunoglobulin heavy
  chain (BCR IGH) gene repertoire skewing and clonotypic evolution up to 22 years
  before CLL diagnosis. However, pathobiological drivers during the earliest stages
  of MBL development remain incompletely characterized. In this study, we utilized
