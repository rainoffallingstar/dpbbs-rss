description: Gene therapy using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors is a promising
  approach for the treatment of monogenic disorders. Long-term multi-year transgene
  expression has been demonstrated in animal models and clinical studies. Nevertheless,
  uncertainties remain concerning the nature of AAV vector persistence and whether
  there is a potential for genotoxicity. Here, we describe the mechanisms of AAV vector
  persistence in the liver of a severe hemophilia A dog model (male = 4, hemizygous,
