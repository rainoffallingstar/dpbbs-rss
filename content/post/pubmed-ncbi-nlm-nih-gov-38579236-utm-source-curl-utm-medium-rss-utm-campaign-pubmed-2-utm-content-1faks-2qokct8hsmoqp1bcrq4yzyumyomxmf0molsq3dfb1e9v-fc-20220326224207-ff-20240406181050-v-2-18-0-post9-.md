description: We studied strong-field multiphoton ionization of 1-iodo-2-methylbutane
  enantiomers with 395 nm circularly polarized laser pulses experimentally and theoretically.
  For randomly oriented molecules, we observe spin polarization up to about 15%, which
  is independent of the molecular enantiomer. Our experimental findings are explained
  theoretically as an intricate interplay between three contributions from HOMO, HOMO-1,
  and HOMO-2, which are formed of 5p-electrons of the iodine atom. For ...
