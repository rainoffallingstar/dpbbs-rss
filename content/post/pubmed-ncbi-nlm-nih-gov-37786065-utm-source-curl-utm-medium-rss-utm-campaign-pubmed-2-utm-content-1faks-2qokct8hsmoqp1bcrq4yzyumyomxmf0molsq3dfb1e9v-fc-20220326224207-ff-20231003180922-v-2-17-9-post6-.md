description: 'CONCLUSION: Automatic segmentation of brain metastases with less than
  four input sequences is feasible with minimal or no loss of quality. A T1-CE-only
  protocol suffices for metastasis segmentation. In contrast, for edema segmentation,
  the combination of T1-CE and FLAIR seems to be important. Missing either T1-CE or
  FLAIR decreases performance. These findings may improve future imaging routines
  by omitting unnecessary sequences, thus speeding up procedures in daily clinical
  practice ...'
