description: The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental
  and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly
  expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and
  functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. The underlying molecular mechanisms,
  however, remained unclear. We show in mice that the synaptic organizer molecule
  C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment
