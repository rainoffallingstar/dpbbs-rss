description: 'CONCLUSION: Consistent with in-vivo studies, RLN exhibit significant
  intrinsic electrophysiological variability in response to tensile forces. Moreover,
  nerve damage progresses even after the complete cessation of strain. Up to 20% of
  nerves with transiently increased post-traumatic amplitudes above 100% developed
  complete LOS, which we termed the "weepy cry." This time-delayed response must be
  considered during the interpretation of C-IONM ...'
