  While white adipocyte dysfunction is a hallmark of obesity-associated disorders,
  thermogenic adipocytes are linked to cardiometabolic health. As adipocytes dynamically
  adapt to environmental cues by functionally switching between white and thermogenic
  phenotypes, a molecular understanding of this plasticity could help improving metabolism.
