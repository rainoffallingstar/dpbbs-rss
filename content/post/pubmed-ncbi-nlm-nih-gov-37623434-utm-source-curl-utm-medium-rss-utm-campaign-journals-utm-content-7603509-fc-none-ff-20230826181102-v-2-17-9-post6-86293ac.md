description: Constitutive MALT1 activity drives survival of malignant lymphomas addicted
  to chronic B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, oncogenic CARD11, or the API2-MALT1
  (also BIRC3::MALT1) fusion oncoprotein. While MALT1 scaffolding induces NF-kB-dependent
  survival signaling, MALT1 protease function is thought to augment NF-kB activation
  by cleaving signaling mediators and transcriptional regulators in B-cell lymphomas.
  However, the pathological role of MALT1 protease function in lymphomagenesis is
