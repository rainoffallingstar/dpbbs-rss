description: Organisms use organic molecules called osmolytes to adapt to environmental
  conditions. In vitro studies indicate that osmolytes thermally stabilize proteins,
  but mechanisms are controversial, and systematic studies within the cellular milieu
  are lacking. We analyzed Escherichia coli and human protein thermal stabilization
  by osmolytes in situ and across the proteome. Using structural proteomics, we probed
  osmolyte effects on protein thermal stability, structure and aggregation, revealing
