description: The protocol put forward in the present paper is an attempt to meet the
  experimentalists' legitimate desire of reliably and easily extracting microscopic
  parameters from current-voltage measurements on molecular junctions. It applies
  to junctions wherein charge transport dominated by a single level (molecular orbital,
  MO) occurs via off-resonant tunneling. The recipe is simple. The measured current-voltage
  curve I = I(V) should be recast as a curve of V^(5/3)/I versus V. This curve exhibits
