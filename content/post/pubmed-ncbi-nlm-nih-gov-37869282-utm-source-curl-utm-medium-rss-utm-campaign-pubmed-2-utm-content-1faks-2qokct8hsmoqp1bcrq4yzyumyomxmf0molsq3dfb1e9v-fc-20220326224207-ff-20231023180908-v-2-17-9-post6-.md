description: This review describes targeted magnetic resonance imaging (tMRI) of small
  changes in the T(1) and the spatial properties of normal or near normal appearing
  white or gray matter in disease of the brain. It employs divided subtracted inversion
  recovery (dSIR) and divided reverse subtracted inversion recovery (drSIR) sequences
  to increase the contrast produced by small changes in T(1) by up to 15 times compared
  to conventional T(1)-weighted inversion recovery (IR) sequences such as ...
