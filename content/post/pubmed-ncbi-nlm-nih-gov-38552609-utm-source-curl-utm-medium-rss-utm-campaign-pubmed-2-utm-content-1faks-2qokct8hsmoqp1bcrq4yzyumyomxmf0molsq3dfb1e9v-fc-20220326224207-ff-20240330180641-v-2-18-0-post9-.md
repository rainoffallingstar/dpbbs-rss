description: The last 50 years have witnessed extraordinary developments in understanding
  mechanisms of carcinogenesis, synthesized as the hallmarks of cancer. Despite this
  logical framework, our understanding of the molecular basis of systemic manifestations
  and the underlying causes of cancer-related death remains incomplete. Looking forward,
  elucidating how tumors interact with distant organs and how multifaceted environmental
  and physiological parameters impinge on tumors and their hosts will be ...
