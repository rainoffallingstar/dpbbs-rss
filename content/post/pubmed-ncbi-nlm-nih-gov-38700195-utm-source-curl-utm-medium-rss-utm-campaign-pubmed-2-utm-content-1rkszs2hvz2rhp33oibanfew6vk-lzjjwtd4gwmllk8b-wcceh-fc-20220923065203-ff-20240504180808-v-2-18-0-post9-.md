description: The assessment of T-cell clonality by flow cytometry has long been suboptimal,
  relying on aberrant marker expression and/or intensity. The introduction of TRBC1
  shows much promise for improving the diagnosis of T-cell neoplasms in the clinical
  flow laboratory. Most laboratories considering this marker already have existing
  panels designed for T-cell workups and will be determining how best to incorporate
  TRBC1. We present this comprehensive summary of TRBC1 and supplemental case examples
