description: Sphingolipid dysregulation is involved in a range of rare and fatal diseases
  as well as common pathologies including cancer, infectious diseases or neurodegeneration.
  Gaining insights into how sphingolipids are involved in these diseases would contribute
  much to our understanding of human physiology, as well as the pathology mechanisms.
  However, scientific progress is hampered by a lack of suitable tools that can be
  used in intact systems. To overcome this, efforts have turned to ...
