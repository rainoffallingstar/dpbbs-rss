description: Immune dysregulation is thought to increase the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma
  (NHL), but the evidence varies by subtype. We evaluated whether antinuclear antibodies
  (ANA), double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-dsDNA), and extractable nuclear antigen
  antibodies (anti-ENA) were associated with the risk of common NHL subtypes in a
  nested case-control study. The autoantibodies were tested in serum collected years
  prior to NHL diagnosis in 832 cases and 809 controls from the Prostate, Lung, ...
