description: '(1) Background: In the treatment of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI),
  the individual host status and previous surgical procedures appear to have a relevant
  influence on success rates and clinical outcome of knee revision surgery. Current
  data about the predictive value are limited in this subgroup of patients. (2) Methods:
