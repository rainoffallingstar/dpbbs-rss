description: We present a calculation of the hyperfine splitting of the 2^{3}S state
  in the ^{3}He atom with inclusion of all QED effects up to α^{3}E_{F}, where E_{F}
  is the Fermi splitting. Using the experimental value of the 1S hyperfine splitting
  in ^{3}He^{+}, we eliminate uncertainties from the nuclear structure and obtain
  the theoretical prediction for ^{3}He of ν_{hfs}=-6 739 701 181(41) Hz, which is
  in perfect agreement with the experimental value -6 739 701 177(16) Hz [S. D. Rosner
  and F. ...
