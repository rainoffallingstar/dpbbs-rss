description: The direct way to estimate the regional fossil fuel CO(2) surplus (ΔffCO(2))
  at a station is by measuring the Δ^(14)CO(2) depletion compared with a respective
  background. However, this approach has several challenges, which are (i) the choice
  of an appropriate Δ^(14)CO(2) background, (ii) potential contaminations through
  nuclear ^(14)CO(2) emissions and (iii) masking of ΔffCO(2) by ^(14)C-enriched biosphere
  respiration. Here we evaluate these challenges and estimate potential biases and
