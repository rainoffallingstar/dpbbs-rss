  that in patients with TIA and minor ischemic stroke, the coexistence of atherosclerosis,
  SVD, cardiac pathology, dissection, or other causes is substantial, and the 5-year
  risk of a major vascular event varies considerably across the 5 categories of underlying
  diseases. These findings further suggest the need for secondary prevention strategies
  based on pathophysiology rather than a one-size-fits-all ...'
