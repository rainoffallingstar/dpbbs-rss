description: Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a rare, developmentally restricted
  and highly lethal cancer of early childhood. The paucity and hypocellularity (due
  to myelofibrosis) of primary patient samples hamper the discovery of cell- and genotype-specific
  treatments. AMKL is driven by mutually exclusive chimeric fusion oncogenes in two
  thirds of cases, with CBFA2T3::GLIS2 (CG2) and NUP98 fusions (NUP98r) representing
  the highest fatality subgroups. We established CD34+ cord blood-derived ...
