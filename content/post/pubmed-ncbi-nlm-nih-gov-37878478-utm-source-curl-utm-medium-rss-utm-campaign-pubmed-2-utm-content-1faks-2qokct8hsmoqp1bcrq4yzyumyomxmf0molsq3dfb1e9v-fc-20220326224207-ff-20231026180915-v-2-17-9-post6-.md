description: Virtual reality (VR) has been shown to be effective in pain management.
  However, to date, little is known about the mechanisms by which immersive experiences
  influence pain processing. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effects
  of an immersive VR environment on the perception of experimental pain in individuals
  with chronic pain and pain-free controls. The immersion in a VR landscape was compared
