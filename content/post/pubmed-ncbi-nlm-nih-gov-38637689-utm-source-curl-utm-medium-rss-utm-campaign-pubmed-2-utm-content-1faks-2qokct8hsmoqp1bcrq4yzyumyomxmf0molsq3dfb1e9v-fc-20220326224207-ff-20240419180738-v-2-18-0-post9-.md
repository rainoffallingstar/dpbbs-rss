description: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) driven by mutations in the DNA damage response
  (DDR) pathway is frequent in patients with cancer and is associated with a higher
  risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs). Here, we analyzed 423 serial
  whole blood and plasma samples from 103 patients with relapsed high-grade ovarian
  cancer receiving carboplatin, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) and
  heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (HSP90i) treatment within the phase II EUDARIO trial
