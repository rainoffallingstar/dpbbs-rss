description: Claudins regulate paracellular permeability, contribute to epithelial
  polarization and are dysregulated during inflammation and carcinogenesis. Variants
  of the claudin-binding domain of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cCPE) are
  highly sensitive protein ligands for generic detection of a broad spectrum of claudins.
  Here, we investigated the preferential binding of YFP- or GST-cCPE fusion proteins
  to non-junctional claudin molecules. Plate reader assays, flow cytometry and microscopy
