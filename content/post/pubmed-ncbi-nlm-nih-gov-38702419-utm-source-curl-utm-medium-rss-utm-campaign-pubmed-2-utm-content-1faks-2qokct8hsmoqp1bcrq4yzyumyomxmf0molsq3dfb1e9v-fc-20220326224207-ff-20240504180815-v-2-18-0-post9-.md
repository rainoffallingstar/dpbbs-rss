  patients exhibit chronic disease with frequent VL recurrence. However, knowledge
  on immunological determinants underlying the disease course is scarce. We longitudinally
  profiled the circulatory cellular immunity of an Ethiopian HIV cohort that included
  VL developers. We show that chronic VL-HIV patients exhibit high and persistent
  levels of TIGIT and PD-1 on CD8^(+)/CD8^(-) T cells, in addition to a lower frequency
