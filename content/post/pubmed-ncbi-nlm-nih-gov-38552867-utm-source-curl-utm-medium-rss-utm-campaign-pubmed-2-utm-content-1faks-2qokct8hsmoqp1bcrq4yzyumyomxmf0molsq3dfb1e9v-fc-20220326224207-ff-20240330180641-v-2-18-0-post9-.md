description: Cathepsin D (CTSD) is a lysosomal aspartic protease and its inherited
  deficiency causes a severe pediatric neurodegenerative disease called neuronal ceroid
  lipofuscinosis (NCL) type 10. The lysosomal dysfunction in the affected patients
  leads to accumulation of undigested lysosomal cargo especially in none-dividing
  cells, such as neurons, resulting in death shortly after birth. To explore which
  proteins are mainly affected by the lysosomal dysfunction due to CTSD deficiency,
  Lund ...
