description: Reliable cell type annotations are crucial for investigating cellular
  heterogeneity in single-cell omics data. Although various computational approaches
  have been proposed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) annotation, high-quality
  cell labels are still lacking in single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible
  chromatin (scATAC-seq) data, because of extreme sparsity and inconsistent chromatin
  accessibility between datasets. Here, we present a novel automated cell ...
