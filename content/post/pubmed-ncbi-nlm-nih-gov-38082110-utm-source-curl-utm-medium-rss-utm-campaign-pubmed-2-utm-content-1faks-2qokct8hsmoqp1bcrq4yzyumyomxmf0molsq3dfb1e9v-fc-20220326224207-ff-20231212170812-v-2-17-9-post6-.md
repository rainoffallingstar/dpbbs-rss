description: Preclinical studies suggest that physiological learning processes are
  similar to changes observed in addiction at the molecular, neuronal and structural
  levels. Based on the importance of classical and instrumental conditioning in the
  development and maintenance of addictive disorders, many have suggested cue-exposure-based
  extinction training of conditioned, drug-related responses as a potential treatment
  of addiction. Recently, the development of virtual reality-assisted cue-exposure
