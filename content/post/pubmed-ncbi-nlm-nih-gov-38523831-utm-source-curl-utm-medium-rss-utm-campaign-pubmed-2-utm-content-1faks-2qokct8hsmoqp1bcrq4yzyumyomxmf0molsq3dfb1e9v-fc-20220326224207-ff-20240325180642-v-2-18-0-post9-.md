description: Given a statistical functional of interest such as the mean or median,
  a (strict) identification function is zero in expectation at (and only at) the true
  functional value. Identification functions are key objects in forecast validation,
  statistical estimation and dynamic modelling. For a possibly vector-valued functional
  of interest, we fully characterise the class of (strict) identification functions
  subject to mild regularity ...
