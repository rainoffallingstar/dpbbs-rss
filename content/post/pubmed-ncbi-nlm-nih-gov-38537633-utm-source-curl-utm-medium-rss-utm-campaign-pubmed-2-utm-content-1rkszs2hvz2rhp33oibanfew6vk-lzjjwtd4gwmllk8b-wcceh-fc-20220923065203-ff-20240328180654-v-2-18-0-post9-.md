description: Hispanic/Latino children have the highest risk of acute lymphoblastic
  leukemia (ALL) in the US compared to other racial/ethnic groups, yet the basis of
  this remains incompletely understood. Through genetic fine-mapping analyses, we
  identified a new independent childhood ALL risk signal near IKZF1 in self-reported
  Hispanic/Latino individuals, but not in non-Hispanic White individuals, with an
  effect size of ∼1.44 (95% confidence interval = 1.33-1.55) and a risk allele frequency
  of ∼18% ...
