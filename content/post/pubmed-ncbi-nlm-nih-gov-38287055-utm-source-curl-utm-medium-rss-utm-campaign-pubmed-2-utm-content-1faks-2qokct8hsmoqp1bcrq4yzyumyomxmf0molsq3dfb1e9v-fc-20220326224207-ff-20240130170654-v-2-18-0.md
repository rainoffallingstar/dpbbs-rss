description: Realizing genetic circuits on single DNA molecules as self-encoded dissipative
  nanodevices is a major step toward miniaturization of autonomous biological systems.
  A circuit operating on a single DNA implies that genetically encoded proteins localize
  during coupled transcription-translation to DNA, but a single-molecule measurement
  demonstrating this has remained a challenge. Here, we use a genetically encoded
  fluorescent reporter system with improved temporal resolution and observe ...
