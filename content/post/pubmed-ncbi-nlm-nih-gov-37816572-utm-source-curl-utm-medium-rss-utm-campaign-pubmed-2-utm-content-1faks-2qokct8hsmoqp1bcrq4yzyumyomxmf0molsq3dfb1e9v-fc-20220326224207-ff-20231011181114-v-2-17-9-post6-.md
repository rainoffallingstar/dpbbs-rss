description: The current evidence for vasovagal syncope management is that cardiac
  pacing is only indicated in a highly select group of patients where symptoms can
  be linked to bradycardic episodes. High spinal cord injury can lead to autonomic
  dysfunction and sympathetic nervous system hypoactivity. A high spinal cord injury
  can theoretically precipitate profound bradycardia leading to haemodynamic instability
  and syncope. A patient in his 50s with a history of C2 spinal injury was admitted
