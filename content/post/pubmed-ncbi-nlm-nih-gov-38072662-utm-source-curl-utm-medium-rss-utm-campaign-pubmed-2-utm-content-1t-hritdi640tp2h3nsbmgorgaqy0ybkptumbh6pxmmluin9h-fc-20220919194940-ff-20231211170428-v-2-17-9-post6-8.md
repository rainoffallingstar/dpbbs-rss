description: Interactions between oncogenic proteins contribute to the phenotype and
  drug resistance. Here, EZH2 (enhancer of zest homolog 2) is identified as a crucial
  factor that mediates HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor) inhibitor resistance. Mechanistically,
  targeting HIF-1 enhanced the activity of EZH2 through transcription activation of
  SUZ12 (suppressor of zest 12 protein homolog). Conversely, inhibiting EZH2 increased
  HIF-1α transcription, but not the transcription of other HIF family ...
