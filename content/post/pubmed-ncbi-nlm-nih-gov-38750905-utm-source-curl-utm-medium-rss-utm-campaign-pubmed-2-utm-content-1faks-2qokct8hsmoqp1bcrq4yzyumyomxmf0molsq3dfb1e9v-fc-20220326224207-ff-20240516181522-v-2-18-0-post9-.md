description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The reduced OER of carbon ions indicated that the required
  dose increase in hypoxic tumors was 17% lower for carbon ions than for photons.
  Additionally, carbon ions reduced the impact of inter-tumor heterogeneity on the
  radiation response. Therefore, carbon ions may be of significant advantage for the
  treatment of hypoxic tumors that are highly resistant to conventional photon ...'
