description: The orbital manifestation of a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is exceptionally
  rare and poses specific challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Its rather exceptional
  behavior among all SFTs comprises a high tendency towards local recurrence, but
  it rarely culminates in metastatic disease. This raises the question of prognostic
  factors in orbital SFTs (oSFTs). Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)-promoter
  mutations have previously been linked to an unfavorable prognosis in SFTs of ...
