description: Queuosine (Q) is a modified nucleoside at the wobble position of specific
  tRNAs. In mammals, queuosinylation is facilitated by queuine uptake from the gut
  microbiota and is introduced into tRNA by the QTRT1-QTRT2 enzyme complex. By establishing
  a Qtrt1 knockout mouse model, we discovered that the loss of Q-tRNA leads to learning
  and memory deficits. Ribo-Seq analysis in the hippocampus of Qtrt1-deficient mice
  revealed not only stalling of ribosomes on Q-decoded codons, but also a ...
