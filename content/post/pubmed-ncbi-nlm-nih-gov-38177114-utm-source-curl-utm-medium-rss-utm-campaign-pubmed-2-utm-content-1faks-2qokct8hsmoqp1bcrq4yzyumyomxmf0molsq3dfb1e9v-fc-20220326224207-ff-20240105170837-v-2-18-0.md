description: Manipulation of the subcellular localization of transcription factors
  by preventing their shuttling via the nuclear pore complex (NPC) emerges as a novel
  therapeutic strategy against cancer. One transmembrane component of the NPC is POM121,
  encoded by a tandem gene locus POM121A/C on chromosome 7. Overexpression of POM121
  is associated with metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes) and unfavorable clinical
  outcome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Peroxisome proliferator-activated...
