description: The ability of marine bacteria to direct their movement in response to
  chemical gradients influences inter-species interactions, nutrient turnover, and
  ecosystem productivity. While many bacteria are chemotactic towards small metabolites,
  marine organic matter is predominantly composed of large molecules and polymers.
  Yet, the signalling role of these large molecules is largely unknown. Using in situ
  and laboratory-based chemotaxis assays, we show that marine bacteria are strongly
