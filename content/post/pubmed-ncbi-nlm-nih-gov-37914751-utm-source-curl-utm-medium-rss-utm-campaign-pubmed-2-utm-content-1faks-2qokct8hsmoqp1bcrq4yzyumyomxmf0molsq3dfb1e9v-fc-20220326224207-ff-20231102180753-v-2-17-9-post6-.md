description: Local cell densities and positioning within cellular monolayers and stratified
  epithelia have important implications for cell interactions and the functionality
  of various biological processes. To analyze the relationship between cell localization
  and tissue physiology, density-based clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN, allow
  for a detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and positioning of individual
  cells. However, these methods rely on predefined parameters that influence ...
