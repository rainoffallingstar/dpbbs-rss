description: Needle insertion simulations play an important role in medical training
  and surgical planning. Most simulations require boundary conforming meshes, while
  the diffuse domain approach, currently limited to stiff needles, eliminates the
  need for meshing geometries. In this article the diffuse domain approach for needle
  insertion simulations is first extended to the use of flexible needles with bevel
  needle tips, which are represented by an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The model parameters
  are tuned ...
