description: Antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease characterized
  by arterial, venous, or microvascular thrombosis, pregnancy morbidities, or non-thrombotic
  manifestations in patients with persistently-positive antiphospholipid antibodies.
  These antibodies bind cellular phospholipids and phospholipid-protein complexes
  resulting in cellular activation and inflammation that ultimately lead to the clinical
  features of antiphospholipid syndrome, including poor placental vascularization.
