description: The image texture features obtained from ^(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
  emission tomography/computed tomography (^(18)F-FDG PET/CT) images of non-small
  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have revealed tumor heterogeneity. A combination of genomic
  data and radiomics may improve the prediction of tumor prognosis. This study aimed
  to predict NSCLC metastasis using a graph neural network (GNN) obtained by combining
  a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network based on gene expression data and image
