description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Age-related differences in 3D trunk kinematics are observed
  from 60 years onward and increase with age. Age-related stiffening of the trunk
  did not seem to affect the body''s total mechanical work. Importantly, our data
  did show a stark contrast between males and females, indicating that training to
  prolong mobility should be tailored to sex. Future research should include sex-matched
  data when examining normal age and pathologic gait ...'

CONCLUSIONS: Age-related differences in 3D trunk kinematics are observed from 60 years onward and increase with age. Age-related stiffening of the trunk did not seem to affect the body's total mechanical work. Importantly, our data did show a stark contrast between males and females, indicating that training to prolong mobility should be tailored to sex. Future research should include sex-matched data when examining normal age and pathologic gait ...
