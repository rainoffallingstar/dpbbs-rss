description: Traditional culture techniques usually retrieve a small fraction of the
  marine microbial diversity, which mainly belong to the so-called rare biosphere.
  However, this paradigm has not been fully tested at a broad scale, especially in
  the deep ocean. Here, we examined the fraction of heterotrophic bacterial communities
  in photic and deep ocean layers that could be recovered by culture-dependent techniques
  at a large scale. We compared 16S rRNA gene sequences from a collection of 2003
