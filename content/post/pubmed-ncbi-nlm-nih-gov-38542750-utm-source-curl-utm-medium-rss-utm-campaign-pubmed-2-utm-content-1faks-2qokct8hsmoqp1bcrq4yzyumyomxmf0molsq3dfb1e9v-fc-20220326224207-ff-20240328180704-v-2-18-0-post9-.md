description: Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the generally accepted indicator
  of vitamin D status. Since hydroxylation of 25(OH)D to 24-25-dihydroxyvitamin D
  (24,25(OH)2D) is the first step of its catabolism, it has been suggested that a
  low 24,25(OH)D level and a low vitamin D metabolite ratio (VMR), i.e., 24,25(OH)2D
  divided by 25(OH)D, may indicate high vitamin D requirements and provide additional
  diagnostic information beyond serum 25(OH)D. We, therefore, evaluated whether ...
