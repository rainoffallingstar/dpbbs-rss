description: Interactions between endocrine-disruptor chemicals (EDCs) and androgen
  receptor (AR) have adverse effects on the endocrine system, leading to human reproductive
  dysfunction. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an EDC that can damage both the environment and
  human health. Although numerous BPA analogues have been produced as substitutes
  for BPA, few studies have evaluated their endocrine-disrupting abilities. We assessed
  the (anti)-androgenic activities of BPA and its analogues using a yeast-based ...
