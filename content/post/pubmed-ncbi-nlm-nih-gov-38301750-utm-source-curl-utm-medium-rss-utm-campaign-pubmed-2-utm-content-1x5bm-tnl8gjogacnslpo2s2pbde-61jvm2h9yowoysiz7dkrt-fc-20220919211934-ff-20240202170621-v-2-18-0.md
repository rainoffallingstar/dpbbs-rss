description: 'CONCLUSION: We present the first interactive XAI platform prototype,
  CLARUS, that allows not only the evaluation of specific human counterfactual questions
  based on user-defined alterations of patient networks and a re-prediction of the
  clinical outcome but also a retraining of the entire GNN after changing the underlying
  graph structures. The platform is currently hosted by the GWDG on https://rshiny.gwdg.de/apps/clarus/.
