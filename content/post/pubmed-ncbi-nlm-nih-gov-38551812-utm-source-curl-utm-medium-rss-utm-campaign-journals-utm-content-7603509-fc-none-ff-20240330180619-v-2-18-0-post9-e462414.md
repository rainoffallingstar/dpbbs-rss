description: Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a form of cell death by which cancer
  treatments can induce a clinically relevant anti-tumor immune response in a broad
  range of cancers. In multiple myeloma (MM), the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
  is an ICD inducer and creates durable therapeutic responses in patients. However,
  eventual relapse and resistance to bortezomib appear inevitable. Here, by integrating
  patient transcriptomic data with an analysis of calreticulin (CRT) protein interactors,
  we found ...
