description: Internal modifications of mRNA have emerged as widespread and versatile
  regulatory mechanism to control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
  Most of these modifications are methyl groups, making S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)
  a central metabolic hub. Here we show that metabolic labeling with a clickable metabolic
  precursor of SAM, propargyl-selenohomocysteine (PSH), enables detection and identification
  of various methylation sites. Propargylated A, C, and G nucleosides form ...
