description: Cisplatin not only targets DNA but also RNA. However, it is largely unknown
  whether platinated RNA (Pt-RNA) causes apoptosis and thus contributes to the cytotoxic
  effects of cisplatin. Consequently, cellular RNA was isolated from HepG2 and LS180
  cells, exposed to cisplatin, and the resulting Pt-RNA (20 ng Pt/µg RNA) was transfected
  into these cancer cell lines or used to treat an apoptosis reporter Caenorhabditis
  elegans (C. elegans) strain (MD701, expressing CED-1::GFP). Cellular and ...
