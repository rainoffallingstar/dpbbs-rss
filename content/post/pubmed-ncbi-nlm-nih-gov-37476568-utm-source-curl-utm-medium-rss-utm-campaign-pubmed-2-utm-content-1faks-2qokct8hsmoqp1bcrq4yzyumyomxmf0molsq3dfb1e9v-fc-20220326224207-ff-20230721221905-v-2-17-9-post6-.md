description: Organic radicals are widely used as linkers or ligands to synthesize
  molecular magnetic materials. However, studies regarding the molecular anisotropies
  of radical-based magnetic materials and their multifunctionalities are rare. Herein,
  a photoisomerizable diarylethene ligand was used to form {[Co^(III)(3,5-DTSQ^(·-))(3,5-DTCat^(2-))](2)(6F-DAE-py(2))}·3CH(3)CN·H(2)O
  (o-1·3CH(3)CN·H(2)O, 6F-DAE-py(2) = 1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-(4-pyridyl)-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene),
