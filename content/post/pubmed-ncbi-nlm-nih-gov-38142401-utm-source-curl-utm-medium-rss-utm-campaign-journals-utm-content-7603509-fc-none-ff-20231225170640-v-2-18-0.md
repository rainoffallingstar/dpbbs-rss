description: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematopoietic
  disorder which occurs on a background of bone marrow failure (BMF). In PNH, chronic
  intravascular hemolysis causes an increase in morbidity and mortality, mainly due
  to thromboses. Over the last 20 years treatment of PNH has focused on the complement
  protein C5 to prevent intravascular hemolysis using the monoclonal antibody eculizumab
  and more recently ravulizumab. In the UK, all patients are under review at one ...
