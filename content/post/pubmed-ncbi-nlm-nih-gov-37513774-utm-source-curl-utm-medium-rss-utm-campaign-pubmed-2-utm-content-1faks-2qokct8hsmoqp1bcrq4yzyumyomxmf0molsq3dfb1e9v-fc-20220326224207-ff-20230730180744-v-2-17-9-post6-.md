description: Viral pneumonia is frequently complicated by bacterial co- or superinfection
  (c/s) with adverse effects on patients' outcomes. However, the incidence of c/s
  and its impact on the outcomes of patients might be dependent on the type of viral
  pneumonia. We performed a retrospective observational study in patients with confirmed
  COVID-19 pneumonia (CP) or influenza pneumonia (IP) from 01/2009 to 04/2022, investigating
  the incidence of c/s using a competing risk model and its impact on mortality ...
