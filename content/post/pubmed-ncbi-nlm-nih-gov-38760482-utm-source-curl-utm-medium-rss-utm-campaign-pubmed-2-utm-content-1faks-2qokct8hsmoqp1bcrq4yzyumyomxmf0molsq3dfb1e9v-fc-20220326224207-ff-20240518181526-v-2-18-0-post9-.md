description: Ground-breaking discoveries have established 5'-AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) as a central sensor of metabolic stress in cells and tissues. AMPK
  is activated through cellular starvation, exercise and drugs by either directly
  or indirectly affecting the intracellular AMP (or ADP) to ATP ratio. In turn, AMPK
  regulates multiple processes of cell metabolism, such as the maintenance of cellular
  ATP levels, via the regulation of fatty acid oxidation, glucose uptake, glycolysis,
