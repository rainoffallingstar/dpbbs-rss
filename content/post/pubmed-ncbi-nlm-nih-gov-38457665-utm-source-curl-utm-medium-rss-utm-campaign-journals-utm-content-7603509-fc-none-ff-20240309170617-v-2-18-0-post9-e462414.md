description: The DNA damage response (DDR) encompasses the detection and repair of
  DNA lesions and is fundamental to the maintenance of genome integrity. Germline
  DDR alterations underlie hereditary chromosome instability syndromes by promoting
  the acquisition of pathogenic structural variants in hematopoietic cells, resulting
  in increased predisposition to hematologic malignancies. Also frequent in hematologic
  malignancies are somatic mutations of DDR genes, typically arising from replication
