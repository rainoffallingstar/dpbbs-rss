description: Seasonal changes and varying degree of corneal hydration has been linked
  to excimer laser corneal ablation rates. The use of PMMA as a calibration material
  in refractive lasers is well established. However, PMMA ablation may be equally
  affected by seasonal variations in temperature and humidity, in turn affecting the
  calibration process. The aim of this work is to analyze the effect of seasonal changes
  in PMMA performance using SCHWIND AMARIS laser system. PET and PMMA ablations conducted
