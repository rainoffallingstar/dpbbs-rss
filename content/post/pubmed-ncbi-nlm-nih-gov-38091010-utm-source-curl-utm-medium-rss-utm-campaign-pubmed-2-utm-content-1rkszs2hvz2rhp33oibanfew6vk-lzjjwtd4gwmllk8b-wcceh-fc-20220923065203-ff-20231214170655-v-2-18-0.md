description: Rare preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (pHSCs) harboring only the
  initiating mutations can be detected at the time of AML diagnosis. pHSCs are the
  origin of leukemia and a potential reservoir for relapse. Using primary human samples
  and gene-editing to model isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant pHSCs, we show
  epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic differences between pHSCs and healthy
  hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). We confirm that IDH1 driven clonal hematopoiesis
  is associated ...
