description: Competing models suggest that physical pain may play an important role
  in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) via pain onset or pain offset, or that pain may
  be absent (analgesia). Few studies have tested these models in the same sample or
  examined factors that could explain differences in NSSI pain experience. We assessed
  1,630 individuals with NSSI histories in an online survey. We descriptively examined
  pain during NSSI and tested preregistered hypotheses that NSSI frequency, NSSI ...
