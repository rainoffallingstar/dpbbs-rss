description: Over the last years, there has been large progress in automated segmentation
  and classification methods in histological whole slide images (WSIs) stained with
  hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques are based
  on diverse datasets of H&E-stained WSIs of different types of predominantly solid
  cancer. However, there is a scarcity of methods and datasets enabling segmentation
  of tumors of the lymphatic system (lymphomas). Here, we propose a solution for segmentation
