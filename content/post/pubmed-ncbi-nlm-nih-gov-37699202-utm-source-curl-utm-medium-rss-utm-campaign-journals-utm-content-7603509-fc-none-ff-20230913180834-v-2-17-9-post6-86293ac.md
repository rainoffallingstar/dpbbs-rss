description: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation serves
  as a curative therapy for many benign and malignant hematopoietic disorders, and
  as a platform for gene therapy. However, growing needs for ex vivo manipulation
  of HSPC graft products are limited by barriers in maintaining critical self-renewal
  and quiescence properties. The role of sphingolipid metabolism in safeguarding these
  essential cellular properties has been recently recognized, but not yet widely explored.
