description: Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are acknowledged for their diverse functional
  and technological properties. This study presents the characterization of EPS400,
  an acidic exopolysaccharide sourced from the native probiotic Limosilactobacillus
  fermentum NCDC400. Notably, this strain has demonstrated previous capabilities in
  enhancing dairy food texture and displaying in vivo hypocholesterolemic activity.
  Our investigation aimed to unveil EPS400's potential biological roles, encompassing
