description: This communication presents a mathematical mechanism-based model of the
  regenerating liver after drug-induced pericentral lobule damage resolving tissue
  microarchitecture. The consequence of alternative hypotheses about the interplay
  of different cell types on regeneration was simulated. Regeneration dynamics has
  been quantified by the size of the damage-induced dead cell area, the hepatocyte
  density and the spatial-temporal profile of the different cell types. We use deviations
