  ALLIANCE041202, ELEVATE-TN, CLL14, and GLOW) evaluating Bruton's tyrosine kinase
  inhibitors (BTKis) and venetoclax-based treatments suggests that these agents have
  reduced but not completely eliminated the overall survival (OS) gap between elderly
  chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and the age and sex-matched general
  population ...
