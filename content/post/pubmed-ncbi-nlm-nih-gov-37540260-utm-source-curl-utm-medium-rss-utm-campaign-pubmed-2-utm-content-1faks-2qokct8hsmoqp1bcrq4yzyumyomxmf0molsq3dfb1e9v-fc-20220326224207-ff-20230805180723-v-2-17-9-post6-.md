description: Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a rare protein deposition disease. It
  is caused by a clonal plasma cell or B‑cell disease in the bone marrow. With the
  exception of the central nervous system, all organs can be affected by amyloid deposits.
  Cardiac involvement is the most frequent organ manifestation that leads to significantly
  increased mortality when it is diagnosed at an advanced stage. The causal treatment
  of AL amyloidosis is reduction of amyloidogenic light chains by chemotherapy. ...
