description: There is growing interest in the use of the enzyme, insulin regulated
  aminopeptidase (IRAP), as a biomarker for conditions such as cardio-metabolic diseases
  and ischemic stroke, with upregulation in its tissue expression in these conditions.
  However, quantification of circulating IRAP has been hampered by difficulties in
  detecting release of the truncated, soluble form of this enzyme into the blood stream.
  The current study aimed to develop a sandwich ELISA using novel antibodies ...
