description: Risk stratification in drug allergy implies that specific risk categories
  (eg, low, moderate, and high) classify historical drug hypersensitivity reactions.
  These risk categories can be based on reaction phenotypic characteristics, the timing
  of the reaction and evaluation, the required reaction management, and individual
  characteristics. Although a multitude of frameworks have been described in the literature,
  particularly for penicillin allergy labels, there has yet to be a global ...
