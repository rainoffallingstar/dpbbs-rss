description: Soft polymer nanocapsules and microgels, which can adapt their shape
  and, at the same time, sequester and release molecular payloads in response to an
  external trigger, are a challenging complement to vesicular structures like polymersomes.
  In this work, we report the synthesis of such capsules by photo-cross-linking of
  coumarin-substituted polyglycidyl ethers, which we prepared by Williamson etherification
  of epichlorohydrin (ECH) repeating units with 7-hydroxycoumarin in copolymers ...
