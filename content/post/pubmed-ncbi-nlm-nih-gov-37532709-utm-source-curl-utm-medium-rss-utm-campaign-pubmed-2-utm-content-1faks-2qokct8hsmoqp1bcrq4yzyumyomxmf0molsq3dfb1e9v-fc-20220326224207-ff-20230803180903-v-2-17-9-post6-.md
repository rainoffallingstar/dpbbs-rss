description: Systemic pan-tumor analyses may reveal the significance of common features
  implicated in cancer immunogenicity and patient survival. Here, we provide a comprehensive
  multi-omics data set for 32 patients across 25 tumor types for proteogenomic-based
  discovery of neoantigens. By using an optimized computational approach, we discover
  a large number of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens. To create a pipeline
  for the identification of neoantigens in our cohort, we combine DNA and ...
