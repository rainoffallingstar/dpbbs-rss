  resection is common; approximately 40% of patients will experience tumor recurrence
  post-surgery. Renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RASis) have been shown to attenuate
  the growth and progression of CRLM in pre-clinical models following liver resection.
  This study examined the efficacy of the RASi captopril on patient-derived colorectal
