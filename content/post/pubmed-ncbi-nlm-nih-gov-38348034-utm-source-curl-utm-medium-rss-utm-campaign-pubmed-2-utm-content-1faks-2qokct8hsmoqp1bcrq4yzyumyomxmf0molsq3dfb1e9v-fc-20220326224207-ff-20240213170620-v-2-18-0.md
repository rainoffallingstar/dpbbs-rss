description: Smoking is a leading risk factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  (COPD), that is characterized by chronic lung inflammation, tissue remodeling and
  emphysema. Although inflammation is critical to COPD pathogenesis, the cellular
  and molecular basis underlying smoking-induced lung inflammation and pathology remains
  unclear. Using murine smoke models and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show that
  smoking establishes a self-amplifying inflammatory loop characterized by an influx
