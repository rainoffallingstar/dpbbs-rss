description: Oxalate, a uremic toxin that accumulates in dialysis patients, is associated
  with cardiovascular disease. As oxalate crystals can activate immune cells, we tested
  the hypothesis that plasma oxalate would be associated with cytokine concentrations
  and cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients. In a cohort of 104 US patients
  with kidney failure requiring dialysis (cohort 1), we measured 21 inflammatory markers.
  As IL-16 was the only cytokine to correlate with oxalate, we focused ...
