description: Mutations leading to a reduced or loss of function in genes of the leptin-melanocortin
  system confer a risk for monogenic forms of obesity. Yet, gain of function variants
  in the melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R) gene predispose to a lower BMI. In individuals
  with reduced body weight, we thus expected mutations leading to an enhanced function
  in the respective genes, like leptin (LEP) and MC4R. Therefore, we have Sanger sequenced
  the coding regions of LEP and MC4R in 462 female patients ...
