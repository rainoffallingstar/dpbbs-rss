description: The T-box transcription factor T-bet is known as a master regulator of
  T-cell response but its role in malignant B cells is not sufficiently explored.
  Here, we conducted single-cell resolved multi-omics analyses of malignant B cells
  from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and studied a CLL mouse model
  with genetic knockout of TBX21. We found that T-bet acts as a tumor suppressor in
  malignant B cells by decreasing their proliferation rate. NF-κB activity induced
