description: Molecular characterization of vascular anomalies has revealed that affected
  endothelial cells (ECs) harbor gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the gene encoding
  the catalytic α subunit of PI3Kα (PIK3CA). These PIK3CA mutations are known to cause
  solid cancers when occurring in other tissues. PIK3CA-related vascular anomalies,
  or "PIKopathies," range from simple, i.e., restricted to a particular form of malformation,
  to complex, i.e., presenting with a range of hyperplasia phenotypes, ...
