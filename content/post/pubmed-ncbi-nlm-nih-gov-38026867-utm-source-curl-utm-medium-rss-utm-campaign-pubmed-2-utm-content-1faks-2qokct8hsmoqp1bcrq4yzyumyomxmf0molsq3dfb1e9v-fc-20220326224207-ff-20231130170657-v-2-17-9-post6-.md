description: 'Introduction: The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type
  2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, enters
  the human body via the epithelial cells of the airway tract. To trap and eject pathogens,
  the airway epithelium is composed of ciliated and secretory cells that produce mucus
  which is expelled through a process called mucociliary clearance. Methods: This
