description: This reference dataset contains biomechanical data of 138 able-bodied
  adults (21-86 years) and 50 stroke survivors walking bare-footed at their preferred
  speed. It is unique due to its size, and population, including adults across the
  life-span and over 70 years, as well as stroke survivors. Full-body kinematics (PiG-model),
  kinetics and muscle activity of 14 back and lower limbs muscles was collected with
  a Vicon motion capture system, ground-embedded force plates, and a synchronized
