description: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a machine learning technique that modifies
  a pretrained model (for example, an LLM or vision transformer) to better suit a
  specific, often smaller, dataset by adjusting only a small, low-rank subset of the
  model's parameters. In this article, we will take a look at both LoRA and DoRA,
