description: Currently, there is no consensus about the use of adjuvant chemotherapy
  for patients with stage II colorectal cancer. Here, we aimed to identify and validate
  a prognostic mRNA expression signature for the stratification of patients with stage
  II colorectal cancer according to their risk for relapse. First, publicly available
  mRNA expression profiling datasets from 792 primary, stage II colorectal cancers
  from six different training cohorts were analyzed to identify genes that are ...
