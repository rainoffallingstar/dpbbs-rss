description: Crohn's disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can
  affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, frequently involving the terminal
  ileum. While colonic mucus alterations in CD patients have been described, terminal
  ileal mucus and its mechanobiological properties have been neglected. Our study
  is the first of its kind to decipher the viscoelastic and network properties of
  ileal mucus. With that aim, oscillatory rheological shear measurements based on
  an airway mucus ...
