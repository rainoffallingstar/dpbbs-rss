description: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that predominantly
  affects the brain. In the coming years, it is expected to spread rapidly, with limited
  progress in diagnostic techniques. Various machine learning (ML) and artificial
  intelligence (AI) algorithms have been employed to detect AD using single-modality
  data. However, recent developments in ML have enabled the application of these methods
  to multiple data sources and input modalities for AD prediction. In this study,
