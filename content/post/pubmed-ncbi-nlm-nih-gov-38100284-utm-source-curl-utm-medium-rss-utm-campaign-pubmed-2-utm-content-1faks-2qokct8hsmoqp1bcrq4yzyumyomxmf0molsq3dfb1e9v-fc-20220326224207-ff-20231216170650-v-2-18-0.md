description: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized biomolecular packages involved
  in intercellular communication. EVs are released by all cells, making them broadly
  applicable as therapeutic, diagnostic, and mechanistic components in (patho)physiology.
  Sample purity is critical for correctly attributing observed effects to EVs and
  for maximizing therapeutic and diagnostic performance. Lipoprotein contaminants
