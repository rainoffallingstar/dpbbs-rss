description: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies detect mRNA expression in single
  cells/spots while preserving their two-dimensional (2D) spatial coordinates, allowing
  researchers to study the spatial distribution of the transcriptome in tissues; however,
  joint analysis of multiple ST slices and aligning them to construct a three-dimensional
  (3D) stack of the tissue still remain a challenge. Here, we introduce spatial architecture
  characterization by deep learning (SPACEL) for ST data analysis. ...
