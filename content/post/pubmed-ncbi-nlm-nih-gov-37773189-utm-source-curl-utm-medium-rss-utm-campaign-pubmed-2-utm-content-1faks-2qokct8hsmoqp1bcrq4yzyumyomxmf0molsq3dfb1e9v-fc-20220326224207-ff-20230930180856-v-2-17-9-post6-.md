description: 'CONCLUSION: We observed variation in joint-specific responses with tofacitinib
  and methotrexate monotherapy. Despite a proximal-distal efficacy gradient, with
  better clinical responses in the feet, patients receiving methotrexate monotherapy
  demonstrated more radiographic progression in the foot joints compared with those
  receiving tofacitinib. These findings suggest that body site- and therapy-specific
  characteristics may interact to produce differential treatment ...'
