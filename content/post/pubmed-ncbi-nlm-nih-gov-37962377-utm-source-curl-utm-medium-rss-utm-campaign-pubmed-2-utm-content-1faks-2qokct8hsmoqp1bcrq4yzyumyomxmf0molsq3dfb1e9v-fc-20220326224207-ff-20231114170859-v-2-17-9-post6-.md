description: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3) is the most
  common autosomal dominant ataxia. In view of the development of targeted therapies,
  knowledge of early biomarker changes is needed. We analyzed cross-sectional data
  of 292 SCA3 mutation carriers. Blood concentrations of mutant ATXN3 were high before
  and after ataxia onset, while neurofilament light deviated from normal 13.3 years
  before onset. Pons and cerebellar white matter volumes decreased and deviated from
  normal ...
