description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis indicates that certain types
  of RPMs have no significant influence on common voice quality parameters and SPL
  compared to recordings without masks. Nevertheless, it is plausible that significant
  differences in acoustic parameters might exist between different mask types. Consequently,
  it is advisable for the clinical practice to always use the same mask type when
  using RPMs to ensure high comparability and accuracy of measurement ...'
