description: We report soluble tetrakis-biphenyl substituted pentacenes comprised
  of sp2 carbons and synthesized from pentacene-5,7,12,14-tetraone. Intramolecular
  Yamamoto coupling of two tetrakis(chlorobiphenylyl)pentacenes yields helical, doubly
  wrapped pentacenes, in which the quaterphenylene units solubilize the pentacenes
  and shield their central anthracene units to an unprecedented degree. The criss-cross-bridged
  pentacenes resist (photo)oxidation, Diels-Alder reactions and are much less reactive
