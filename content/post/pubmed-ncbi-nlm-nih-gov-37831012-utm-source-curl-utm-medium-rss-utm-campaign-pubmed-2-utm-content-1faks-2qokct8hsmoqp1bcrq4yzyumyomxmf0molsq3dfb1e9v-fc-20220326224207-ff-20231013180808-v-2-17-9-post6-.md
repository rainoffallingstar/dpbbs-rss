description: Iron ions in a square-planar coordination can bind molecules at the vacant
  axial positions and are able to transform them in stoichiometric and catalytic reactions.
  Nature takes advantage of these properties by incorporating iron into porphyrin
  systems, which play a key role not only in the binding and transport of oxygen,
  but also in catalytic oxidation and reduction reactions involving cytochrome P450.
  Although these systems have been studied extensively, there are still unresolved
