description: 'CONCLUSION: This trial with three microdosed FXaI suggests that at most
  the rivaroxaban dose should be reduced during short-term ritonavir, and only in
  patients receiving high maintenance doses. Thorough time series analyses demonstrated
  differential effects on three different drug-metabolising enzymes over time with
