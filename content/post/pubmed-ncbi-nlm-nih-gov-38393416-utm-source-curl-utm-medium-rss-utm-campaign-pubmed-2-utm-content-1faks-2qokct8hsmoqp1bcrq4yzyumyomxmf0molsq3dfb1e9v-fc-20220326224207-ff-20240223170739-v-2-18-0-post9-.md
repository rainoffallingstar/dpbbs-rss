description: Sclerostin (SOST) is produced by osteocytes and is known as a negative
  regulator of bone homeostasis. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulates calcium, phosphate
  as well as vitamin D metabolism, and is a strong inhibitor of SOST synthesis in
  vitro and in vivo. PTH has two methionine amino acids (positions 8 and 18) which
  can be oxidized. PTH oxidized at Met18 (Met18(ox)-PTH) continues to be bioactive,
  whereas PTH oxidized at Met8 (Met8(ox)-PTH) or PTH oxidized at Met8 and Met18 ...
