description: Phenotyping of model organisms grown on Petri plates is often carried
  out manually, despite the procedures being time-consuming and laborious. The main
  reason for this is the limited availability of automated phenotyping facilities,
  whereas constructing a custom automated solution can be a daunting task for biologists.
  Here, we describe SPIRO, the Smart Plate Imaging Robot, an automated platform that
  acquires time-lapse photographs of up to four vertically oriented Petri plates in
