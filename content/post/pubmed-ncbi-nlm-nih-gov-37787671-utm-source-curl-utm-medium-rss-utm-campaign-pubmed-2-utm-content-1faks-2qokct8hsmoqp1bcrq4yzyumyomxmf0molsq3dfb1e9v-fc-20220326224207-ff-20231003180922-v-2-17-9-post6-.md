description: Background Clinicians consider both imaging and nonimaging data when
  diagnosing diseases; however, current machine learning approaches primarily consider
  data from a single modality. Purpose To develop a neural network architecture capable
  of integrating multimodal patient data and compare its performance to models incorporating
  a single modality for diagnosing up to 25 pathologic conditions. Materials and Methods
  In this retrospective study, imaging and nonimaging patient data were ...
