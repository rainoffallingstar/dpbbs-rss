description: To examine the size of the ciliary body stroma (CBS) in dependence of
  the morphology of the anterior chamber angle in enucleated human eyes, we histomorphometrically
  examined human enucleated eyes. The study included 107 eyes (with a mean axial length
  of 25.1 ± 2.8 mm (range 21.0-36.0 mm). The anterior chamber angle was open in 68
  eyes and it was closed and endothelialized in 39 eyes. The maximal CBS width (541
  ± 210 µm versus 59 ± 179 µm; P < 0.001) and the minimal CBS width (214 ± 107 ...
