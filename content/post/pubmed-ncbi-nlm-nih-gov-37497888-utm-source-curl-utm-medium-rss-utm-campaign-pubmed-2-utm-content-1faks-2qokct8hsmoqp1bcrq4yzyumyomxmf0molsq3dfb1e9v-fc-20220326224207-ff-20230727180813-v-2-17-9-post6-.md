description: SLN124, an N-acetylgalactosamine conjugated 19-mer short interfering
  RNA, is being developed to treat iron-loading anemias (including beta-thalassemia
  and myelodysplastic syndromes) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (polycythemia vera).
  Through hepatic targeting and silencing of the TMPRSS6 gene, SLN124 increases endogenous
  hepcidin synthesis. This is the first clinical report of an siRNA targeting a component
  of iron homeostasis. This first-in-human, phase 1 study assessed the ...
