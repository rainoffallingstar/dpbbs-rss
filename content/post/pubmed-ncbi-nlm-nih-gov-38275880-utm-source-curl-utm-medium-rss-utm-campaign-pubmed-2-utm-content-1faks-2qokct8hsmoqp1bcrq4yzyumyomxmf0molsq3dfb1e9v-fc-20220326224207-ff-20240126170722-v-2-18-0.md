description: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits considerable variability
  in patient outcome. It has been reported that SOX2 plays a role in proliferation,
  tumor growth, drug resistance, and metastasis in a variety of cancer types. Additionally,
  SOX9 has been implicated in immune tolerance and treatment failures. SOX2 and SOX9
  induce treatment failure by a molecular mechanism that has not yet been elucidated.
  This study explores the inverse association of SOX2/SOX9 and their ...
