description: The SS18-SSX fusion drives oncogenic transformation in synovial sarcoma
  by bridging SS18, a member of the mSWI/SNF (BAF) complex, to Polycomb repressive
  complex 1 (PRC1) target genes. Here we show that the ability of SS18-SSX to occupy
  H2AK119ub1-rich regions is an intrinsic property of its SSX C terminus, which can
  be exploited by fusion to transcriptional regulators beyond SS18. Accordingly, SS18-SSX
  recruitment occurs in a manner that is independent of the core components and ...
