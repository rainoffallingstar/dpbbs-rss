description: Genome-scale metabolic models are powerful tools for understanding cellular
  physiology. Flux balance analysis (FBA), in particular, is an optimization-based
  approach widely employed for predicting metabolic phenotypes. In model microbes
  such as Escherichia coli, FBA has been successful at predicting essential genes,
  i.e. those genes that impair survival when deleted. A central assumption in this
  approach is that both wild type and deletion strains optimize the same fitness objective.
