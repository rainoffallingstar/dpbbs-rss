  radiology reports from images have the potential to enhance efficiency and reduce
  the workload of radiologists. However, evaluating the correctness of these reports
  requires metrics that can capture clinically pertinent differences. In this study,
  we investigate the alignment between automated metrics and radiologists' scoring
