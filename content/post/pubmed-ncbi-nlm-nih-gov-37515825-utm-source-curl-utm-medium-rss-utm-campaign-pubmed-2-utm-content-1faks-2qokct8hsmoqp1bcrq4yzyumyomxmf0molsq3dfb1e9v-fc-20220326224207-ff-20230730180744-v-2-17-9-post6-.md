description: The benefits of ultrasound are its ease-of-use and its ability to precisely
  deliver energy in opaque and complex media. However, most materials responsive to
  ultrasound show a weak response, requiring the use of high powers, which are associated
  with undesirable streaming, cavitation, or temperature rise. These effects hinder
  response control and may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is
  applied. Moreover, materials that are currently in use rely on all-or-nothing ...
