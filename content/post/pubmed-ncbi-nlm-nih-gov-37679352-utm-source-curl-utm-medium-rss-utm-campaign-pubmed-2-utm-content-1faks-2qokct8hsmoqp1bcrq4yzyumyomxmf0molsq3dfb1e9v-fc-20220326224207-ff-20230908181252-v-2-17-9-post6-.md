description: This study compared the optical quality and chromatic performance of
  refractive-diffractive intraocular lenses (IOLs) that are designed to extend the
  range of vision of pseudophakic patients and alter chromatic aberration. Five IOLs
  were evaluated, Tecnis Synergy and Triumf POD L GF, both intended to compensate
  for eye's chromatism, as well as Acriva Trinova Pro C-a lens that increases chromatic
  aberration, and AT Lisa Tri and AcrySof IQ PanOptix. An optical setup composed of
  a corneal ...
