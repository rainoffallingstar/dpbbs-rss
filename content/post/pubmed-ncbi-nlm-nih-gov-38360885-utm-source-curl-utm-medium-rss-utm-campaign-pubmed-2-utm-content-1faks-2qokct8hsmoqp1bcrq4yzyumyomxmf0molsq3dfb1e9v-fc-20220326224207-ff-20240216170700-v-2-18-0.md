description: Cotranslational protein folding depends on general chaperones that engage
  highly diverse nascent chains at the ribosomes. Here we discover a dedicated ribosome-associated
  chaperone, Chp1, that rewires the cotranslational folding machinery to assist in
  the challenging biogenesis of abundantly expressed eukaryotic translation elongation
  factor 1A (eEF1A). Our results indicate that during eEF1A synthesis, Chp1 is recruited
  to the ribosome with the help of the nascent polypeptide-associated ...
