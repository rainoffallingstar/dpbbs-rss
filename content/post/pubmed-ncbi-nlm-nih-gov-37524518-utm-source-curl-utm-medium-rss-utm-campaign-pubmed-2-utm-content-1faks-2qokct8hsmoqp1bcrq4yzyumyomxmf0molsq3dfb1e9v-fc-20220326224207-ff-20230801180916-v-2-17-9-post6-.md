description: 'CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, perforation was approximately twice as frequent
  in MeVO than in LVO thrombectomy. Efforts to optimize the procedure may focus on
  navigation beyond the occlusion site and retraction of stent retriever/aspiration
  catheter. Further research is necessary in order to identify thrombectomy candidates
  at high risk of intraprocedural perforation and to provide data on the effectiveness
  of endovascular ...'
