description: The human leukocyte antigene E (HLA-E) is associated with tumorigenesis
  in various cancers. Immunoncology along with sex-specific aspects in cancer therapy
  are now in scientific focus. Therefore, immunohistochemical HLA-E expression was
  retrospectively analysed in a cohort of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) after
  surgical therapy. Then, serum concentration of HLA-E (sHLA-E) was quantified in
  a prospective cohort by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High HLA-E expression
  was associated ...
