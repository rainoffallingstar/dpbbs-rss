description: Current evaluation of treatment response in solid tumors depends on dynamic
  changes in tumor diameters as measured by imaging. However, these changes can only
  be detected when there are enough macroscopic changes in tumor volume, which limits
  the usability of radiological response criteria in evaluating earlier stages of
  disease response and necessitates much time to lapse for gross changes to be notable.
  One promising approach is to incorporate dynamic changes in circulating tumor DNA
