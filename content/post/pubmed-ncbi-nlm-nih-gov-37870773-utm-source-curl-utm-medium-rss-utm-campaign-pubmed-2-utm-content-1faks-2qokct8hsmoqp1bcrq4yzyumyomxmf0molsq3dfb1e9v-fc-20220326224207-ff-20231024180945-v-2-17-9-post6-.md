description: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects
  the central nervous system and can result in various symptoms, including muscle
  weakness, spasticity, and fatigue, ultimately leading to the deterioration of the
  musculoskeletal system. However, in recent years, exosuits have emerged as a game-changing
  solution to assist individuals with MS during their daily activities. These lightweight
  and affordable wearable robotic devices have gained immense popularity. In our study,
