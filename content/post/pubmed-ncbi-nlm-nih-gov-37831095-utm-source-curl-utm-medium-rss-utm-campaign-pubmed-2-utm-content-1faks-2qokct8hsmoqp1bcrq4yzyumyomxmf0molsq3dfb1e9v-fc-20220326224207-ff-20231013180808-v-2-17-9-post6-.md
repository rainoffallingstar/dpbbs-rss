description: The application of high-throughput sequencing methods for population-based
  genomic newborn screening offers numerous opportunities for improving population
  health. The use of genome-based sequencing technology holds potential to enable
  the diagnosis of virtually any genetic disorder at an early stage and offers great
  flexibility when it comes to selection and expansion of target diseases. National
