description: This study presents a novel reverse-engineering approach to generate
  recombinant anti-PF4 antibodies from VITT-patient sera. These antibodies recapitulate
  functional effects of original serum anti-PF4 clonotypes, identify key PF4 binding
  residues and hold promise as valuable tools to investigate VITT ...
