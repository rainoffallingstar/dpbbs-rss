description: Neuromuscular junctions are the synapses between motor neurons and skeletal
  muscle fibers, which mediate voluntary muscle movement. Since neuromuscular junctions
  are also tightly associated with the capping function of terminal Schwann cells,
  these synapses have been classically regarded as tripartite chemical synapses. Although
  evidences from sympathetic innervation of neuromuscular junctions was described
  approximately a century ago, the essential presence and functional relevance ...
