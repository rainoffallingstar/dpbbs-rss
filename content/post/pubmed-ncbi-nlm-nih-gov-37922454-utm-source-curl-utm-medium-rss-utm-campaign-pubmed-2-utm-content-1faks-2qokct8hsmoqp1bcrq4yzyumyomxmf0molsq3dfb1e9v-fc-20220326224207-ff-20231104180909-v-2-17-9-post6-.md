description: Regulation of lineage biases in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells
  (HSPCs) is pivotal for balanced hematopoietic output. However, little is known about
  the mechanism behind lineage choice in HSPCs. Here, we show that mRNA decay factors
  Regnase-1 (Reg1; Zc3h12a) and Regnase-3 (Reg3; Zc3h12c) are essential for determining
  lymphoid fate and restricting myeloid differentiation in HSPCs. Loss of Reg1 and
  Reg3 resulted in severe impairment of lymphopoiesis and a mild increase in myelopoiesis
