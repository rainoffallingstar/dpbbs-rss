description: Developmental gene expression data from medulloblastoma (MB) suggest
  that WNT-MB originates from the region of the embryonic lower rhombic lip (LRL),
  whereas SHH-MB and non-WNT/non-SHH MB arise from cerebellar precursor matrix regions.
  This study aimed to analyze detailed intraoperative data with regard to the site
  of origin (STO) and compare these findings with the hypothesized regions of origin
  associated with the molecular group. A review of the institutional database identified
