description: Malnutrition is ubiquitous in cirrhotic patients presenting for liver
  transplant (LT). Providing an appropriate energy prescription is fundamental to
  effective nutrition therapy. We aimed to compare measured energy expenditure (mEE)
  with predicted energy expenditure (pEE) in patients awaiting LT and determine clinical
  factors associated with mEE. In this prospective observational study, energy expenditure
  was measured by indirect calorimetry in 110 adult patients referred for LT and predicted
