description: The tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters use an
  extra cytoplasmic substrate binding protein (SBP) to transport a wide variety of
  substrates in bacteria and archaea. The SBP can adopt an open- or closed state depending
  on the presence of substrate. The two transmembrane domains of TRAP transporters
  form a monomeric elevator whose function is strictly dependent on the presence of
  a sodium ion gradient. Insights from experimental structures, structural predictions
