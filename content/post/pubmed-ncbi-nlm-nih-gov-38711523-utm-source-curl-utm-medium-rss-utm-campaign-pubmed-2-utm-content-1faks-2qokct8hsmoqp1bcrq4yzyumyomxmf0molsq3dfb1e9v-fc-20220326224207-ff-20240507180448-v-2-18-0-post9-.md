description: The discovery of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 (SOCS1) in 1997 marked
  a significant milestone in understanding the regulation of Janus kinase/Signal transducer
  and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways. Subsequent research
  deciphered its cellular functions, and recent insights into SOCS1 deficiencies in
  humans underscored its critical role in immune regulation. In humans, SOCS-haploinsufficiency
  (SOCS1-HI) presents a diverse clinical spectrum, encompassing ...
