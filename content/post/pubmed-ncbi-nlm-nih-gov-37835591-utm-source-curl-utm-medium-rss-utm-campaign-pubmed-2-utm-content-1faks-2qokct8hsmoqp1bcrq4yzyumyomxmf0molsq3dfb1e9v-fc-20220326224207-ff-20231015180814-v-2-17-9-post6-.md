description: Neural-network-based outcome predictions may enable further treatment
  personalization of patients with head and neck cancer. The development of neural
  networks can prove challenging when a limited number of cases is available. Therefore,
  we investigated whether multitask learning strategies, implemented through the simultaneous
  optimization of two distinct outcome objectives (multi-outcome) and combined with
  a tumor segmentation task, can lead to improved performance of convolutional ...
