  Australia (or 2% of patients recommended for radiation therapy) may preferentially
  benefit from CIRT for initial therapy of radiation resistant tumours, or to boost
  persistently active disease after other therapies, or for re-irradiation of recurrent
  disease. On this basis, one national carbon ion facility with up to four treatment
  rooms is justified for Australian ...'
