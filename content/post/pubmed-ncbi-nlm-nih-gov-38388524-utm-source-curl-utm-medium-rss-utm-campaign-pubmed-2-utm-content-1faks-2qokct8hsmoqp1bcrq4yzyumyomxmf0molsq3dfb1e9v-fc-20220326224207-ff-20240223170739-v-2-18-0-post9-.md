description: The analysis of ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM) lipid species using
  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) continues to present challenges
  as their precursor mass and fragmentation can correspond to multiple molecular arrangements.
  To address this constraint, we developed ReTimeML, a freeware that automates the
  expected retention times (RTs) for Cer and SM lipid profiles from complex chromatograms.
  ReTimeML works on the principle that LC-MS/MS experiments ...
