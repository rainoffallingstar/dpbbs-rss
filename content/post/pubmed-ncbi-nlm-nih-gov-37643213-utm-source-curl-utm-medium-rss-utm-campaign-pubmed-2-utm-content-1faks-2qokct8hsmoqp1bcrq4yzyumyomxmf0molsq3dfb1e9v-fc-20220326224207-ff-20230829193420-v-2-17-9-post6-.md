description: Targeted inhibitors of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET)-bromodomains
  and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling demonstrate potent but self-limited
  antilymphoma activity as single agents in the context of cellular Myelocytomatosis
  (cMYC) oncogene-dysregulation. However, combined PI3K and BET inhibition imparts
  synergistic anticancer activity with the potential for more sustained disease responses
  due to the mutual antagonism of compensatory epigenetic and signaling networks.
