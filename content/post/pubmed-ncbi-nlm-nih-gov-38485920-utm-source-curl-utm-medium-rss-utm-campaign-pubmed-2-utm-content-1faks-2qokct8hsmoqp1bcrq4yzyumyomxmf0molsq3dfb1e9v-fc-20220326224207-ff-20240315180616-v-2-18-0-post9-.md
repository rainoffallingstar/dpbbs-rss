description: Contractile rings are formed from cytoskeletal filaments during cell
  division. Ring formation is induced by specific crosslinkers, while contraction
  is typically associated with motor protein activity. Here, we engineer DNA nanotubes
  and peptide-functionalized starPEG constructs as synthetic crosslinkers to mimic
  this process. The crosslinker induces bundling of ten to hundred DNA nanotubes into
  closed micron-scale rings in a one-pot self-assembly process yielding several thousand
  rings ...
