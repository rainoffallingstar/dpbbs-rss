description: Understanding pharmacokinetics (PK) in children is a prerequisite to
  determine optimal pediatric dosing. As plasma sampling in children is challenging,
  alternative PK sampling strategies are needed. In this case study we evaluated the
  suitability of saliva as alternative PK matrix to simplify studies in infants, investigating
  metamizole, an analgesic used off-label in infants. Six plasma and 6 saliva PK sample
  collections were scheduled after a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg ...
