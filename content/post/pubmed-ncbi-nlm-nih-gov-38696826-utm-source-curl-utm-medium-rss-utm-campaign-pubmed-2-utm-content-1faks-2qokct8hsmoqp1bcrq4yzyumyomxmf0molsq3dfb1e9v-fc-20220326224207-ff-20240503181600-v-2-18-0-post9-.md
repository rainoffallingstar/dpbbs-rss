description: Permanent electronic ring currents are supported within manifolds of
  Γ(E) degenerate excited electronic states as E(±) = E(x) ± iE(y) excitations. In
  [ Phys. Rev. Res. 2021, 3, L042003] we showed the existence of inverse-current manifolds,
  where the direction of the electronic ring current in each degenerate state E(±)
  is opposite to the circular polarization of the generating light fields. This vibronic
  effect is caused by the exchange of orbital angular momentum between the electrons
  and ...
