description: Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) exits cells by direct translocation
  across the plasma membrane, a type I pathway of unconventional protein secretion.
  This process is initiated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P(2))-dependent
  formation of highly dynamic FGF2 oligomers at the inner plasma membrane leaflet,
  inducing the formation of lipidic membrane pores. Cell surface heparan sulfate chains
  linked to glypican-1 (GPC1) capture FGF2 at the outer plasma membrane leaflet, ...
