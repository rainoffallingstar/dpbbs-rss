description: Pyridine is a ubiquitous building block for the design of very diverse
  ligand platforms, many of which have become indispensable for catalytic transformations.
  Nevertheless, the isosteric pyrazine, pyrimidine, and triazine congeners have enjoyed
  thus far a less privileged role in ligand design. In this review, several applications
  of such fragments in the design of new catalysts are presented. In a significant
  number of cases described, diazine- and triazine-based ligands either outperform
