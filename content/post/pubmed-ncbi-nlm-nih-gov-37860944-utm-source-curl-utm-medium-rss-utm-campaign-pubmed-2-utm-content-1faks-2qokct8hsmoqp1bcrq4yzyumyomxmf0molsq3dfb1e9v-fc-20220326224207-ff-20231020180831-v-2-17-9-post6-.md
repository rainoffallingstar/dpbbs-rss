description: In this work, matrix isolation spectroscopy and quantum-chemical calculations
  are used together to analyse the structure and properties of weakly bound dimers
  of the two isomers benzo[a]acridine and benzo[c]acridine. Our measured experimental
  electronic absorbance spectra agree with simulated spectra calculated for the equilibrium
  structures of the dimers in gas-phase, but in contrast, disagree with the simulated
  spectra calculated for the structures obtained by optimising the ...
