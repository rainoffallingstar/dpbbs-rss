description: Accurate small vessel stent visualization using CT remains challenging.
  Photon-counting CT (PCD-CT) may help to overcome this issue. We systematically investigate
  PCD-CT impact on small vessel stent assessment compared to energy-integrating-CT
  (EID). 12 water-contrast agent filled stents (3.0-8 mm) were scanned with patient-equivalent
  phantom using clinical PCD-CT and EID-CT. Images were reconstructed using dedicated
  vascular kernels. Subjective image quality was evaluated by 5 ...
