description: Antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) inhibit bacterial growth in several
  infection models. Since PNAs are not spontaneously taken up by bacteria, they are
  often conjugated to carriers such as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) in order to
  improve translocation. Hydrophobic counterions such as pyrenebutyrate (PyB) have
  been shown to facilitate translocation of peptides over natural and artificial membranes.
  In this study, the capability of PyB to support translocation of CPP-coupled ...
