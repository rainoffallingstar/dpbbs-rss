  are unlikely due to different effects on important pregnane X receptor (NR1I2) splice
  variants

description: Rifampicin and rifabutin can activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR, NR1I2),
  thereby inducing pharmacokinetically important genes/proteins and reducing exposure
  to co-administered drugs. Because induction effects vary considerably between these
  antibiotics, differences could be due to unequal rifamycin-induced activation or
  tissue expression of the three major NR1I2 splice variants, PXR.1 (NM_003889), PXR.2
  (NM_022002), and PXR.3 (NM_033013). Consequently, PXR activation (PXR reporter ...
