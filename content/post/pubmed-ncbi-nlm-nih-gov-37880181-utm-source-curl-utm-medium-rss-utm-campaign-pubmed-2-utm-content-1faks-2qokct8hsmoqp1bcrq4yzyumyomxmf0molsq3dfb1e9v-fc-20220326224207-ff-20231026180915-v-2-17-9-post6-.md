description: 'CONCLUSION: In the context of CART, the additional use of TGR^(pre-BL)
  and its change to TGR^(post-BL) determined at 30-day FU1 showed better OS prognostication
  for patients with overall PD according to Lugano criteria. Therefore, this modification
  of the Lugano classification should be explored as a potential novel imaging biomarker
  of early response and should be validated prospectively in future ...'
