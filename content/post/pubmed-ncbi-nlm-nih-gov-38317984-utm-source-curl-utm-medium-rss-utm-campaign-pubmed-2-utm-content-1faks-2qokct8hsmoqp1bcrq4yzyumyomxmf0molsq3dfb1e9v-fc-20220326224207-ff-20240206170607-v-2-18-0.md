description: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease
  involving selective vulnerability of energy-intensive motor neurons (MNs). It has
  been unclear whether mitochondrial function is an upstream driver or a downstream
  modifier of neurotoxicity. We separated upstream genetic determinants of mitochondrial
  function, including genetic variation within the mitochondrial genome or autosomes;
  from downstream changeable factors including mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtCN).
