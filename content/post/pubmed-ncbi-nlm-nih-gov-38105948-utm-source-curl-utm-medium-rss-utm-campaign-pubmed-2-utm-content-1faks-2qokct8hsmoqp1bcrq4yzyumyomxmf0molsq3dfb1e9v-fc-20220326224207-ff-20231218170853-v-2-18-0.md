description: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a complex condition associated with adverse
  health consequences that affect millions of individuals worldwide. Epigenetic modifications,
  including DNA methylation (5mC), have been associated with AUD and other alcohol-related
  traits. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have identified differentially
  methylated genes associated with AUD in human peripheral and brain tissue. More
  recently, epigenetic studies of AUD have also evaluated DNA hydroxymethylation...
