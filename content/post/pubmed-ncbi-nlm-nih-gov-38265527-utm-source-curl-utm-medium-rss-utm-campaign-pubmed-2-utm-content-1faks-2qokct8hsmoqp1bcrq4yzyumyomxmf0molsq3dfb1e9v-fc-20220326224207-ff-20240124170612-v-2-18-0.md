description: Posterior fossa type A (PF-EPN-A, PFA) ependymoma are aggressive tumors
  that mainly affect children and have a poor prognosis. Histopathology shows significant
  intratumoral heterogeneity, ranging from loose tissue to often sharply demarcated,
  extremely cell-dense tumor areas. To determine molecular differences in morphologically
  different areas and to understand their clinical significance, we analyzed 113 PF-EPN-A
  samples, including 40 corresponding relapse samples. Cell-dense areas ranged ...
