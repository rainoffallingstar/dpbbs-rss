description: Supplementary motor area syndrome (SMAS) represents a common neurosurgical
  sequela. The incidence and time frame of its occurrence have yet to be characterized
  after surgery for brain tumors. We examined patients suffering from a brain tumor
  preoperatively, postoperatively, and during follow-up examinations after three months,
  including fine motor skills testing and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
