description: The addition of midostaurin to standard chemotherapy has improved survival
  in patients with FLT3-mutated AML. However, the impact of midostaurin and other
  FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) on cardiovascular adverse events (CAEs) has not been studied
  in patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in
  a real-world setting. We reviewed 132 patients with AML who were treated with intensive
  induction therapy and consecutive allogeneic stem cell transplantation at our ...
