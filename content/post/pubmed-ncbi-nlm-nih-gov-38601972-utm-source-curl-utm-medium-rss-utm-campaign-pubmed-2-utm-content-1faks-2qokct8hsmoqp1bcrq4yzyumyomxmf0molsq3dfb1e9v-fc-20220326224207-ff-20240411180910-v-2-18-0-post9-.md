description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a fast-progressing hematological malignancy
  affecting myeloid cells, is typically treated with chemotherapy or hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation. However, approximately half of the patients face relapses
  and 5-year survival rates are poor. With the goal to facilitate dual-specificity,
  boosting anti-tumor activity, and minimizing the risk for antigen escape, this study
  focused on combining chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) ...
