description: We investigated whether physical load has an influence on the accuracy
  of duration estimation of sporting activities presented in real time and slow motion.
  86 participants were studied in two single sessions of 45 min each. Our results
  showed no general effects for physical load, when comparing physical load versus
  rest. However, we could replicate findings of past research (Schütz et al., 2021),
  showing that the duration of sports performance is estimated more accurately when
  presented in ...
