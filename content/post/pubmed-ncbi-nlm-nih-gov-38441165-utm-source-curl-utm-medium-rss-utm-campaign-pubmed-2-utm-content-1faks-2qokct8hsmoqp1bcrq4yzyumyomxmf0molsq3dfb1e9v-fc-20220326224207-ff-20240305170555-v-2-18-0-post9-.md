description: Gut barrier dysfunction and related inflammation are known to be associated
  with the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated
  associations of 292 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 27 genes related
  to endotoxins/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing and tolerance, mucin synthesis, inflammation,
  and Crohn's disease with colon and rectal cancer risks. Incident CRC cases (N=1,374;
  colon=871, rectum=503) were matched 1:1 to controls nested within the ...
