description: Sepsis is characterised by a dysregulated host immune response to infection.
  Despite recognition of its significance, immune status monitoring is not implemented
  in clinical practice due in part to the current absence of direct therapeutic implications.
  Technological advances in immunological profiling could enhance our understanding
