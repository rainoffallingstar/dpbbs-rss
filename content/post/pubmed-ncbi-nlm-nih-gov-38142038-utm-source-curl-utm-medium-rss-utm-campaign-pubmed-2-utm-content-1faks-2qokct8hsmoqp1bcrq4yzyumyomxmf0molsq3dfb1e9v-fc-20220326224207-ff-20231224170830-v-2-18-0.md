description: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the primary causes
  of nephrotic syndrome in both pediatric and adult patients, which can lead to end-stage
  kidney disease. Recurrence of FSGS after kidney transplantation significantly increases
  allograft loss, leading to morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no consensus
  guidelines for identifying those patients who are at risk for recurrence or for
  the management of recurrent FSGS (rFSGS). Our workgroup performed a literature ...
