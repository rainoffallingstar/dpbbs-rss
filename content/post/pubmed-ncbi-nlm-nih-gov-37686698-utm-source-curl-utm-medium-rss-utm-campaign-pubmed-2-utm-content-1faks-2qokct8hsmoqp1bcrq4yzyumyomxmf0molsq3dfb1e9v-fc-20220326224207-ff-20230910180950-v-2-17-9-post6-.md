description: Hyper-angiogenesis is a typical feature of glioblastoma (GBM), the most
  aggressive brain tumor. We have reported the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase
  1A3 (ALDH1A3) in proliferating vasculature in GBM patients. We hypothesized that
  ALDH1A3 may act as an angiogenesis promoter in GBM. Two GBM cell lines were lentivirally
  transduced with either ALDH1A3 (ox) or an empty vector (ev). The angiogenesis phenotype
  was studied in indirect and direct co-culture of endothelial cells (ECs) with ...
