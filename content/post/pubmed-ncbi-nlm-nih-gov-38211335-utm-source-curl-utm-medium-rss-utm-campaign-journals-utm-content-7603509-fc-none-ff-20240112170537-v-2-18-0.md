description: Maintenance of quiescence and DNA replication dynamics are two paradoxical
  requirements for the distinct states of dormant and active hematopoietic stem cells
  (HSCs), which are required to preserve the stem cell reservoir and replenish the
  blood cell system in response to hematopoietic stress respectively. Here, we show
