description: Proteomics is making important contributions to drug discovery, from
  target deconvolution to mechanism of action (MoA) elucidation and the identification
  of biomarkers of drug response. Here we introduce decryptE, a proteome-wide approach
  that measures the full dose-response characteristics of drug-induced protein expression
  changes that informs cellular drug MoA. Assaying 144 clinical drugs and research
  compounds against 8,000 proteins resulted in more than 1 million dose-response curves
