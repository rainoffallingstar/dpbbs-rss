description: Tamoxifen is widely used in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast
  cancer. The polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 is primarily responsible for metabolic activation
  of tamoxifen, resulting in substantial interindividual variability of plasma concentrations

  below which tamoxifen treatment is less efficacious have been proposed but not validated,
