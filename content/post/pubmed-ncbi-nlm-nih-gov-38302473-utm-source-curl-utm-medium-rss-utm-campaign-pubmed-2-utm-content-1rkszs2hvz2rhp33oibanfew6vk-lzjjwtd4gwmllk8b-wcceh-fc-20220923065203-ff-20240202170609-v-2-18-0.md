description: The MYC oncogene is often dysregulated in human cancer, including hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). MYC is considered undruggable to date. Here, we comprehensively
  identify genes essential for survival of MYC^(high) but not MYC^(low) cells by a
  CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screen in a MYC-conditional HCC model. Our screen uncovers
  novel MYC synthetic lethal (MYC-SL) interactions and identifies most MYC-SL genes
  described previously. In particular, the screen reveals nucleocytoplasmic transport
  to be ...
