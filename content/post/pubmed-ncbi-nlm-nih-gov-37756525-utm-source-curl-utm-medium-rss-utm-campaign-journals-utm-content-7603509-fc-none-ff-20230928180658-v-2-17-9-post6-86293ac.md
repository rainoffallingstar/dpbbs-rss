description: Growth Factor Independence 1 (GFI1) is a DNA-binding transcription factor
  and a key regulator of haematopoiesis. GFI1-36N is a germline variant causing a
  change of serine (S) to asparagine (N) at position 36. We previously reported that
  the GFI1-36N allele has a prevalence of 10-15% among patients with acute myeloid
  leukemia (AML) and 5-7% among healthy Caucasians and promotes the development of
  this disease. Using a multi-omics approach, we show here that GFI1-36N expression
  is associated ...
