description: Cerebral organoids recapitulate the structure and function of the developing
  human brain in vitro, offering a large potential for personalized therapeutic strategies.
  The enormous growth of this research area over the past decade with its capability
  for clinical translation makes a non-invasive, automated analysis pipeline of organoids
  highly desirable. This work presents a novel non-invasive approach to monitor and
  analyze cerebral organoids over time using high-field magnetic resonance ...
