description: Cholangiocarcinomas (CCA) are a heterogeneous group of tumors that are
  classified as intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal according to the anatomic location
  within the biliary tract. Each CCA subtype is associated with distinct genomic alterations,
  including single nucleotide variants, copy number variants, and chromosomal rearrangements
  or gene fusions, each of which can influence disease prognosis and/or treatment
  outcomes. Molecular profiling using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a ...
