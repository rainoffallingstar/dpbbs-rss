description: Changes in the pharmacokinetic and resulting pharmacodynamic properties
  of drugs are common in many chronic liver diseases, leading to adverse effects,
  drug interactions and increased risk of over- or underdosing of medications. Structural
  and functional hepatic impairment can have major effects on drug metabolism and
