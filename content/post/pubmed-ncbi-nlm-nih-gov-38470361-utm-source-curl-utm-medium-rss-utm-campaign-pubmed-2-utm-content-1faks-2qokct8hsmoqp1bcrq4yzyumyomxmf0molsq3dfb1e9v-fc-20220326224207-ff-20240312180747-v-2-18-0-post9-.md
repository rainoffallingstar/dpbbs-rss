description: Quenched or frozen-in structural disorder is ubiquitous in real experimental
  systems. Much of the progress is achieved in understanding the phase separation
  of such systems using the diffusion-driven coarsening in an Ising model with quenched
  disorder. But there is a paucity of research on the phase-separation kinetics in
  fluids with quenched disorder. In this paper, we present results from a detailed
  molecular dynamics simulation, showing the effects of randomly placed localized
