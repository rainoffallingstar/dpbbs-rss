description: Loss and/or deterioration of refuelling habitats have caused population
  declines in many migratory bird species but whether this results from unequal mortality
  among individuals varying in migration traits remains to be shown. Based on 13 years
  of body mass and size data of great knots (Calidris tenuirostris) at a stopover
  site of the Yellow Sea, combined with resightings of individuals marked at this
  stopover site along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, we assessed year to year
