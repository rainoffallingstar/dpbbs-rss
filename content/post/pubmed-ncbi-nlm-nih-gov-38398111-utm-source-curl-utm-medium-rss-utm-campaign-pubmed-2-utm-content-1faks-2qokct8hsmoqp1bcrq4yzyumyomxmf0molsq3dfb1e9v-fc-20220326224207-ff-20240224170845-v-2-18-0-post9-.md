description: Squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCLC) is associated with high mortality
  and limited treatment options. Identification of therapeutic targets and prognostic
  biomarkers is still lacking. This research aims to analyze the transcriptomic profile
  of SqCLC samples and identify the key genes associated with tumorigenesis, overall
  survival (OS), and a profile of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Differential
