description: Malignancy-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (mal-HLH) is
  a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome with poor prognosis. We evaluated mal-HLH in
  Sweden with regard to population-based incidence, clinical features, and survival.
  Using the Swedish Patient Registry for 1997-2018, we identified 307 adults (≥18-years)
  and 9 children (209 males, 107 females; p<0.001), with both an HLH-related diagnosis
