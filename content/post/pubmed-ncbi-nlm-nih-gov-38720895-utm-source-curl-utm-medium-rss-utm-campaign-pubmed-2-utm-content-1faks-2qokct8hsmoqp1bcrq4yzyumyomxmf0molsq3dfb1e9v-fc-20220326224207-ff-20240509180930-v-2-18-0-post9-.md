description: 'CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect of chamomile-
  derived products on primary human T cells. These findings provide molecular explanations
  for the observed anti-inflammatory action of chamomile and imply a broader use of
  chamomile extracts in T cell driven chronic inflammatory diseases such as chronic
