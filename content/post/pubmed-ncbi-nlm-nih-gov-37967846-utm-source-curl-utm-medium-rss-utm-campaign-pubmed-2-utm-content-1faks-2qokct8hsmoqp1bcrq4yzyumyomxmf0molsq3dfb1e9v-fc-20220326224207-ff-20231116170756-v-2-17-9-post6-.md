description: Coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic characterized
  by serious lung disease and thrombotic events in the venous and circulation trees,
  which represent a harmful clinical sign of poor outcome. Thrombotic events are more
  frequent in patients with severe disease requiring intensive care units and are
  associated with platelet and clotting activation. However, after resolution of acute
  infection, patients may still have clinical sequelae, the so-called long-COVID-19,
