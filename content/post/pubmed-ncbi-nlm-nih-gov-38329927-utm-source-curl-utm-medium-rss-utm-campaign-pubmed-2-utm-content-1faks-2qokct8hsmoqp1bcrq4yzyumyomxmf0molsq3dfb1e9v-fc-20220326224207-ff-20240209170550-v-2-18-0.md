description: Complex diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) cover a wide range of
  biological scales, from genes and proteins to cells and tissues, up to the full
  organism. In fact, any phenotype for an organism is dictated by the interplay among
  these scales. We conducted a multilayer network analysis and deep phenotyping with
  multi-omics data (genomics, phosphoproteomics and cytomics), brain and retinal imaging,
  and clinical data, obtained from a multicenter prospective cohort of 328 patients
  and ...
