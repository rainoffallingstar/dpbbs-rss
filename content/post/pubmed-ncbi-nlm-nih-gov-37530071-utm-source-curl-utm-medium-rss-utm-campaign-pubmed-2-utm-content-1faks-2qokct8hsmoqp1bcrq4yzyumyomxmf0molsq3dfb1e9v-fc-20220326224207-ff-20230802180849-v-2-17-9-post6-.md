  in living cells is crucial to understand their complex biochemical roles. Recently,
  we developed RhoBAST, one of the most photostable and brightest fluorescence light-up
  aptamers (FLAPs), as a genetically encoded tag for imaging messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
  Here, we describe programmable RhoBAST sequences flanked by target-binding hybridization
  arms that light up only when bound to the untagged target RNA in trans. As part
