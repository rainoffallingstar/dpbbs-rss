description: Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) is a newly developed bronchoscopic
  technique for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). The objective
  of this meta-analysis was to analyze the diagnostic yield and safety of RAB in patients
  with PPLs. Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov)
  were searched from inception to April 2023. Two independent investigators screened
  retrieved articles, extracted data, and assessed the study quality. The ...
