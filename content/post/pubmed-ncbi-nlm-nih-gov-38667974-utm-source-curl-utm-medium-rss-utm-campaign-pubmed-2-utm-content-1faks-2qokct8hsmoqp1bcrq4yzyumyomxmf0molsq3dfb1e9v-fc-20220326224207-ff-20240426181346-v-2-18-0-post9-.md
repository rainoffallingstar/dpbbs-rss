description: Mixed reality (MxR) enables the projection of virtual three-dimensional
  objects into the user's field of view via a head-mounted display (HMD). This phantom
  model study investigated three different workflows for navigated common femoral
  arterial (CFA) access and compared it to a conventional sonography-guided technique
  as a control. A total of 160 punctures were performed by 10 operators (5 experts
  and 5 non-experts). A successful CFA puncture was defined as puncture at the mid-level
