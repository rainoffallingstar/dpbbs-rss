description: An amplitude analysis of B^{-}→J/ψΛp[over ¯] decays is performed using
  4400 signal candidates selected on a data sample of pp collisions recorded at center-of-mass
  energies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV with the LHCb detector, corresponding to an integrated
  luminosity of 9 fb^{-1}. A narrow resonance in the J/ψΛ system, consistent with
  a pentaquark candidate with strangeness, is observed with high significance. The
  mass and the width of this new state are measured to be 4338.2±0.7±0.4 MeV and ...
