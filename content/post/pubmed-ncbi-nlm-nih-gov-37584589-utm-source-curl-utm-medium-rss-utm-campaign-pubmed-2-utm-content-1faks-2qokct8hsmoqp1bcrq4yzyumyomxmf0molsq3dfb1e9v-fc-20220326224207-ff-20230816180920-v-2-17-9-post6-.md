description: Mitochondria are dynamic organelles regulated by fission and fusion processes.
  The fusion of membranes requires elaborative coordination of proteins and lipids
  and is particularly crucial for the function and quality control of mitochondria.
  Phosphatidic acid (PA) on the mitochondrial outer membrane generated by PLD6 facilitates
  the fusion of mitochondria. However, how PA promotes mitochondrial fusion remains
  unclear. Here, we show that a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, NME3, is ...
