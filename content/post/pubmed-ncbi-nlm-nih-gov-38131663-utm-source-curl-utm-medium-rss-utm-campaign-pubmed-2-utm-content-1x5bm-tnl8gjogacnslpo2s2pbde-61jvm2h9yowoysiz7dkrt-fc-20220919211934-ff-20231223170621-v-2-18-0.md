description: 'CONCLUSION: Our KIRC risk prediction model, constructed using 10 cuproptosis-related
  genes, had good independent prognostic ability. In addition, we screened four highly
  sensitive drugs and predicted relevant targets for these four drugs that might treat
  KIRC. Finally, literature research revealed that four drug-target interactions have
  been demonstrated in previous studies and the remaining targets are potential sites
  of drug action for future ...'
