description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is difficult to diagnose in the
  early stages and lacks reliable biomarkers. The scope of this project was to establish
  quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to comprehensively study
  blood serum alterations in PDAC patients. Serum samples from 34 PDAC patients obtained
  before and after pancreatectomy as well as 83 age- and sex-matched control samples
  from healthy donors were analyzed with in vitro diagnostics research (IVDr) proton
