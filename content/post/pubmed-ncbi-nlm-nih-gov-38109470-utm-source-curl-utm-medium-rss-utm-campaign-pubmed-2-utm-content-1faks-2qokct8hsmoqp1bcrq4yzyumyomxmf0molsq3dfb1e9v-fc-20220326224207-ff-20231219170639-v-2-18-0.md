description: We present a fluorescence-detection system for laser-cooled 9Be+ ions
  based on silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) operated at 4 K and integrated into our
  cryogenic 1.9 T multi-Penning-trap system. Our approach enables fluorescence detection
  in a hermetically sealed cryogenic Penning-trap chamber with limited optical access,
  where state-of-the-art detection using a telescope and photomultipliers at room
  temperature would be extremely difficult. We characterize the properties of the
  SiPM in ...
