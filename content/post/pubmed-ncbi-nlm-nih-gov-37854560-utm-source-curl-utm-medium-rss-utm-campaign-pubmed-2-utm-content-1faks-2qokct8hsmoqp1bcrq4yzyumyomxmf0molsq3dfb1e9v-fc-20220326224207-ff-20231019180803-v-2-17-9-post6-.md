description: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is conventionally used for structural
  imaging of tissue. Calibrating the intensity values of OCT images can give information
  on the tissue's inherent optical properties, such as the attenuation coefficient,
  which can provide an additional parameter to quantify possible pathological changes.
  To obtain calibrated intensity values, the focus position and Rayleigh length of
  the incident beam need to be known. We explore the feasibility of extracting the
