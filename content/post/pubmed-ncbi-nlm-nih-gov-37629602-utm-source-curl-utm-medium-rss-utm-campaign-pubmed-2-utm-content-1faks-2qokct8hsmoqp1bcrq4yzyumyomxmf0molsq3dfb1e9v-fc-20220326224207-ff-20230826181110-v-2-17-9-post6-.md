description: Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) and transporters play a major role in
  drug efficacy and safety. They are regulated at multiple levels and by multiple
  factors. Estimating their expression and activity could contribute to predicting
  drug pharmacokinetics and their regulation by drugs or pathophysiological situations.
  Determining the expression of these proteins in the liver, intestine, and kidney
  requires the collection of biopsy specimens. Instead, the isolation of extracellular
  vesicles ...
