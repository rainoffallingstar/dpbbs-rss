description: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells confers migratory
  abilities, a crucial aspect in the metastasis of tumors that frequently leads to
  death. In multiple studies authors proposed gene expression signatures for EMT,
  stemness, or mesenchymality of tumors based on bulk tumor expression profiling.
  However, recent studies suggested that non-cancerous cells from the micro- or macroenvironment
  (TME) heavily influence such signature profiles. Here, we strengthen these findings
