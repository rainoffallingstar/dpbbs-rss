description: Precision oncology is a field of personalized medicine in which tumor
  biology forms the basis for tailored treatments. The preferred approach currently
  applied in clinical practice is based on the concept of malignant tumors as genetic
  diseases that are caused by mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. On the
  one hand, these can be targeted by molecular drugs, while on the other hand, next-generation
  sequencing allows for comprehensive analysis of all relevant aberrations, thus ...
