description: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) comprises a severe hyperinflammatory
  phenotype driven by the overproduction of cytokines, many of which signal via the
  JAK/STAT pathway. Indeed, the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib has demonstrated efficacy
  in pre-clinical studies and early-phase clinical trials in HLH. Nevertheless, concerns
  remain for ruxolitinib-induced cytopenias, which are postulated to result from the
  blockade of JAK2-dependent hematopoietic growth factors. To explore the ...
