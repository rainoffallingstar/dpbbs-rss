description: Despite the functional impact of cognitive deficit in people with psychosis,
  objective cognitive assessment is not typically part of routine clinical care. This
  is partly due to the length of traditional assessments and the need for a highly
  trained administrator. Brief, automated computerised assessments could help to address
  this issue. We present data from an evaluation of PsyCog, a computerised, non-verbal,
  mini battery of cognitive tests. Healthy Control (HC) (N = 135), Clinical High ...
