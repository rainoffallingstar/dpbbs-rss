description: Hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions are important in many biological
  systems. As these reactions are hard to observe experimentally, it is of high interest
  to shed light on them using simulations. Here, we present a machine learning model
  based on graph neural networks for the prediction of energy barriers of HAT reactions
  in proteins. As input, the model uses exclusively non-optimized structures as obtained
  from classical simulations. It was trained on more than 17 000 energy ...
