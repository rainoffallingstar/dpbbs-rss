description: Blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with the
  MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib has produced promising results in patients with head
  and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the current study, we showed that trametinib
  treatment leads to overexpression and activation of the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) in HNSCC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Knockdown of
  EGFR improved trametinib treatment efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically,
