description: Solubility is one of the most important properties of protein. Protein
  solubility can be greatly changed by single amino acid mutations and the reduced
  protein solubility could lead to diseases. Since experimental methods to determine
  solubility are time-consuming and expensive, in-silico methods have been developed
  to predict the protein solubility changes caused by mutations mostly through protein
  evolution information. However, these methods are slow since it takes long time
