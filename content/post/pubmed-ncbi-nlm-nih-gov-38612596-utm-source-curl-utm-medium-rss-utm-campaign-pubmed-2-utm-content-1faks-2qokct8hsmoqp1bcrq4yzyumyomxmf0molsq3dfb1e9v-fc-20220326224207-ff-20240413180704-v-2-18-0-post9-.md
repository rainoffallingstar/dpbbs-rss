description: A better understanding of the function of neutrophil extracellular traps
  (NETs) may facilitate the development of interventions for sepsis. The study aims
  to investigate the formation and degradation of NETs in three murine sepsis models
  and to analyze the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during NET formation.
  Murine sepsis was induced by midgut volvulus (720° for 15 min), cecal ligation and
  puncture (CLP), or the application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 mg/kg body weight
