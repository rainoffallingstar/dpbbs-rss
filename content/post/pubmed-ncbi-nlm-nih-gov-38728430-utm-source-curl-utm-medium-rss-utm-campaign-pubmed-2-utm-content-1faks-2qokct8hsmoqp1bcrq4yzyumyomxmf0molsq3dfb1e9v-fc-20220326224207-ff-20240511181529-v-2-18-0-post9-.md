description: Acquisition of a hyperdiploid (HY) karyotype or immunoglobulin heavy
  chain (IGH) translocations are considered key initiating events in multiple myeloma
  (MM). To explore if other genomic events can precede these events, we analyzed whole-genome
  sequencing (WGS) data from 1173 MM samples. Integrating molecular time and structural
  variants (SV) within early chromosomal duplications, we indeed identified pre-gain
  deletions in 9.4% of HY patients without IGH translocations, challenging HY as ...
