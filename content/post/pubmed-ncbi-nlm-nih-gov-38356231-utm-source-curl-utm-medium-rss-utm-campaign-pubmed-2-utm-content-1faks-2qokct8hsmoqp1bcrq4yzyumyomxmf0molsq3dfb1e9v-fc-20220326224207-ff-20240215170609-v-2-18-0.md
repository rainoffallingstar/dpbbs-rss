description: Statistical data simulation is essential in the development of statistical
  models and methods as well as in their performance evaluation. To capture complex
  data structures, in particular for high-dimensional data, a variety of simulation
  approaches have been introduced including parametric and the so-called plasmode
  simulations. While there are concerns about the realism of parametrically simulated
  data, it is widely claimed that plasmodes come very close to reality with some aspects
