description: Short bowel syndrome (SBS) following extensive intestinal resection is
  often characterized by impaired absorption of orally administered drugs, including
  tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). We report the case of a patient with EGFR-mutated
  non-small cell lung carcinoma treated with 80 mg/d of the TKI osimertinib who achieved
  partial response of the tumor, but was subsequently subjected to a double-barreled
  jejunostomy due to ileus. Due to the development of SBS after the bypass surgery,
