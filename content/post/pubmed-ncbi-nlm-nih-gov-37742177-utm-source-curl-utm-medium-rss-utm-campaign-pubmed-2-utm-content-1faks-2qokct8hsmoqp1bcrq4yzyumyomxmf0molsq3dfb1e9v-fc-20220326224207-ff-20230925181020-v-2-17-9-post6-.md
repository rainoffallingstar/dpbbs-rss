description: Recent technical advances, such as single-cell RNA sequencing and mass
  cytometry, improve identification of cell types and subsets in a range of healthy
  and diseased tissues at the expense of their cellular and molecular context. Here,
  we present a protocol for in situ multispectral imaging to map myeloid cell heterogeneity
  in tissue cryosections, describing steps for cutting sequential sections, antibody
  titration, and building a spectral library. We then detail procedures for ...
