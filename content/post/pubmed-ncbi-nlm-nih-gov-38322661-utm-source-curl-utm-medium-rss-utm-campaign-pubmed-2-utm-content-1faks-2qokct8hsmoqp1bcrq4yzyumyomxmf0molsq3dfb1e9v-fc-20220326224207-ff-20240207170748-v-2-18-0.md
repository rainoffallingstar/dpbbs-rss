description: Although human tenocytes and dermal fibroblasts have shown promise in
  tendon engineering, no tissue engineered medicine has been developed due to the
  prolonged ex vivo time required to develop an implantable device. Considering that
  macromolecular crowding has the potential to substantially accelerate the development
  of functional tissue facsimiles, herein we compared human tenocyte and dermal fibroblast
  behaviour under standard and macromolecular crowding conditions to inform future
  studies ...
