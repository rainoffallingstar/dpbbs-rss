description: p190RhoGAP, which exists in two paralogs, p190RhoGAP-A (p190A) and p190RhoGAP-B
  (p190B), is a GTPase activating protein (GAP) contributing to the regulation of
  the cellular activity of RhoGTPases. Recent data showed that M(2) muscarinic acetylcholine
  receptor (M(2)R) stimulation in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCM) induces the
  binding of p190RhoGAP to the long isoform of the regulator of G protein signaling
  3 (RGS3L). This complex formation alters the substrate preference of p190RhoGAP
