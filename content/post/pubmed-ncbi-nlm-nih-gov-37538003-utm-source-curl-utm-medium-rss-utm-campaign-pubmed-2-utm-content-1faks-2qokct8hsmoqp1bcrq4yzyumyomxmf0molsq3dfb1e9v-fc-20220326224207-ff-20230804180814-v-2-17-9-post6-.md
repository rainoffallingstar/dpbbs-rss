description: Human health is determined both by genetics (G) and environment (E).
  This is clearly illustrated in groups of individuals who are exposed to the same
  environmental factor showing differential responses. A quantitative measure of the
  gene-environment interactions (GxE) effects has not been developed and in some instances,
  a clear consensus on the concept has not even been reached; for example, whether
  cancer is predominantly emerging from "bad luck" or "bad lifestyle" is still debated.
