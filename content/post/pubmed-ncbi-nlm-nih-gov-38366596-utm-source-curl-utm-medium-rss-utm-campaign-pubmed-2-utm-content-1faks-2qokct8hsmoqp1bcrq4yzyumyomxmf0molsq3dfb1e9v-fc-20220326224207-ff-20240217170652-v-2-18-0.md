description: The expression of growth/differentiation factor (GDF) 15 increases in
  the ganglionic eminence (GE) late in neural development, especially in neural stem
  cells (NSCs). However, GDF15 function in this region remains unknown. We report
  that GDF15 receptor is expressed apically in the GE and that GDF15 ablation promotes
  proliferation and cell division in the embryonic GE and in the adult ventricular-subventricular
  zone (V-SVZ). This causes a transient generation of additional neuronal ...
