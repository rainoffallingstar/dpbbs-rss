description: Genomic newborn screening (gNBS) is on the horizon given the decreasing
  costs of sequencing and the advanced understanding of the impact of genetic variants
  on health and diseases. Key to ongoing gNBS pilot studies is the selection of target
  diseases and associated genes to be included. In this study, we present a comprehensive
  analysis of seven published gene-disease lists from gNBS studies, evaluating gene-disease
  count, composition, group proportions, and ClinGen curations of ...
