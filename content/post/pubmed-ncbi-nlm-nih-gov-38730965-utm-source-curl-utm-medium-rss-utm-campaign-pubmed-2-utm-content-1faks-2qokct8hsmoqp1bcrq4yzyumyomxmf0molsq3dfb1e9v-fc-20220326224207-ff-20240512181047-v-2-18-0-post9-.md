description: This study aimed to assess the suitability of printed zirconia (ZrO(2))
  for adhesive cementation compared to milled ZrO(2). Surface conditioning protocols
  and disinfection effects on bond strength were also investigated. ZrO(2) discs (n
  = 14/group) underwent either alumina (Al(2)O(3)) airborne particle abrasion (APA;
  50 µm, 0.10 MPa) or tribochemical silicatisation (TSC; 110 µm Al(2)O(3), 0.28 MPa
  and 110 µm silica-modified Al(2)O(3), 0.28 MPa), followed by disinfection (1 min
  immersion in ...
