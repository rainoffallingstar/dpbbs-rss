description: Chromosomal translocation (4;14), an adverse prognostic factor in multiple
  myeloma (MM), drives overexpression of the histone methyltransferase NSD2. A genome-wide
  CRISPR screen in MM cells identified adenylate kinase 2 (AK2), an enzyme critical
  for high energy phosphate transfer from the mitochondria, as an NSD2-driven vulnerability.
  AK2 suppression in t(4;14) MM cells decreased NADP(H) critical for conversion of
  ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleosides, leading to replication stress, DNA ...
