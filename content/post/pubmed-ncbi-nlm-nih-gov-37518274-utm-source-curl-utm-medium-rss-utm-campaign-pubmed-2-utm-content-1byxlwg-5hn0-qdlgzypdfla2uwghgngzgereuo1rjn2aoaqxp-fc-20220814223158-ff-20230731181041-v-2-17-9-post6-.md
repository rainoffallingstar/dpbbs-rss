description: Follicular lymphoma is one of the most frequent lymphomas. Histologically,
  it is characterized by a follicular (nodular) growth pattern of centrocytes and
  centroblasts; mixed with variable immune microenvironment cells. Clinically, it
  is characterized by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, and splenomegaly.
  It is biologically and clinically heterogeneous. In most patients it is indolent,
  but others have a more aggressive evolution with relapses; and transformation to
