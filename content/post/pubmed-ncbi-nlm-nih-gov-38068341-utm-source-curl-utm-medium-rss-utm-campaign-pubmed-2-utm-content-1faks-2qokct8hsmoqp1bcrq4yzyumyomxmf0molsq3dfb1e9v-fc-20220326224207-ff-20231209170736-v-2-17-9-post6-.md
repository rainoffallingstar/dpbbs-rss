description: Endovascular therapy (EVT) is the standard treatment for ischemic stroke
  caused by a large vessel occlusion (LVO). The effectiveness of EVT for distal medium
  vessel occlusions (MDVOs) is still uncertain, but newer, smaller devices show potential
  for EVT in MDVOs. The new Solitaire X 3 mm device offers a treatment option for
  MDVOs. Our study encompassed consecutive cases of primary and secondary MDVOs treated
