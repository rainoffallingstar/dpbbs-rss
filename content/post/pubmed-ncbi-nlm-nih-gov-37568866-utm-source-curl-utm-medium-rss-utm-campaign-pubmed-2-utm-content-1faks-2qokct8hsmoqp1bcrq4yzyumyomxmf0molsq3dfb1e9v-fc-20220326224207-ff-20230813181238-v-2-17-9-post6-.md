description: Preoperative and postoperative diagnostics play an important role in
  ensuring the safety of patients with phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs). The risk
  of endothelial cell loss can be addressed by regularly measuring the endothelial
  cell density using specular microscopy and considering the endothelial cell loss
  rate and the endothelial reserve in accordance with the patient's age when deciding
  whether to explant a pIOL. The anterior chamber morphometrics, including the anterior
  chamber depth ...
