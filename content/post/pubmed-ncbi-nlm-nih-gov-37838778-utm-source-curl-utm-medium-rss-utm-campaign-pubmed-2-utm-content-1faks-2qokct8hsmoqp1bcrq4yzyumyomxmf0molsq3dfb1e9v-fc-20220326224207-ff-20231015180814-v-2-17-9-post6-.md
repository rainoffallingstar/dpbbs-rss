description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) responds poorly to systemic treatment,
  including new immunotherapeutic approaches. Biomarkers are urgently needed for early
  disease detection, patient stratification for treatment, and response prediction.
  The role of soluble CD40 (sCD40) is unknown in PDAC. In this study, we performed
  a quantitative multiplex analysis of 17 immune checkpoint proteins in serum samples
  from patients with various stages of PDAC in a discovery study (n = 107) and ...
