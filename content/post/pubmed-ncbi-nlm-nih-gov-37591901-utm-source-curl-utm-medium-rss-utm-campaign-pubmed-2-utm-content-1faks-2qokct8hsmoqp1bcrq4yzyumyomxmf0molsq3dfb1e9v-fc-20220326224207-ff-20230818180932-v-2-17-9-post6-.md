description: Xanthines such as caffeine and theobromine are among the most consumed
  psychoactive stimulants in the world, either as natural components of coffee, tea
  and chocolate, or as added ingredients. The present study assessed if xanthines
  affect liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). Cultured primary rat LSEC were
  challenged with xanthines at concentrations typically obtained from normal consumption
  of xanthine-containing beverages, food or medicines; and at higher concentrations
