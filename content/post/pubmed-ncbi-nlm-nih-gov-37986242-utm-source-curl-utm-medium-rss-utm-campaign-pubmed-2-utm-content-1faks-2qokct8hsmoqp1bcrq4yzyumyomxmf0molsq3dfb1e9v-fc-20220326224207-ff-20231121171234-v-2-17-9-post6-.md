description: A π-expanded X-type double [5]helicene comprising dihydropyracylene moieties
  was synthesized from commercially available acenaphthene. X-ray crystallographic
  analysis revealed the unique highly twisted structure of the compound resulting
  in the occurrence of two enantiomers which were separated by chiral HPLC, owing
  to their high conformational stability. The compound shows strongly bathochromically
  shifted UV/vis absorption and emission bands with small Stokes shift and ...
