description: Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is responsible for many childhood cancers in sub-Saharan
  Africa, where it is linked to recurrent or chronic infection by Epstein-Barr virus
  or Plasmodium falciparum. However, whether human leukocyte antigen (HLA) polymorphisms,
  which regulate immune response, are associated with BL has not been well investigated,
  which limits our understanding of BL etiology. Here we investigate this association
  among 4,645 children aged 0-15 years, 800 with BL, enrolled in ...
