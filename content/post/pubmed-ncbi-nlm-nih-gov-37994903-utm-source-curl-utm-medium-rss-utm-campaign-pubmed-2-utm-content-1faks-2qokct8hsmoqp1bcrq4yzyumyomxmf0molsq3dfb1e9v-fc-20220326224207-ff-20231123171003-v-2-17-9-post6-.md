description: Reproducible research and open science practices have the potential to
  accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs, and
  by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results.
  However, these practices are uncommon in many fields, so there is a clear need for
  training that helps and encourages researchers to integrate reproducible research
  and open science practices into their daily work. Here, we outline eleven strategies
