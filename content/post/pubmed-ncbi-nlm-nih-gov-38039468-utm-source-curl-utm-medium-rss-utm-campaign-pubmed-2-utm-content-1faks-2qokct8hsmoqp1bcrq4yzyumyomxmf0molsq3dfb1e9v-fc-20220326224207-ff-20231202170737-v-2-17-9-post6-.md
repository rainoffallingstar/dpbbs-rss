description: The polarization of Λ and Λ[over ¯] hyperons along the beam direction
  has been measured relative to the second and third harmonic event planes in isobar
  Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at sqrt[s_{NN}]=200 GeV. This is the first experimental
  evidence of the hyperon polarization by the triangular flow originating from the
  initial density fluctuations. The amplitudes of the sine modulation for the second
  and third harmonic results are comparable in magnitude, increase from central to
