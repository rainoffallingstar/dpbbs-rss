  a generally more active (mesor) and consistent (24-h autocorrelation) RAR, with
  a pronounced peak activity (amplitude) and a marked difference between daytime and
  nighttime activity (dichotomy index) was found to be associated with lower fatigue,

  if restoring RAR among survivors of CRC could help to alleviate symptoms of fatigue
