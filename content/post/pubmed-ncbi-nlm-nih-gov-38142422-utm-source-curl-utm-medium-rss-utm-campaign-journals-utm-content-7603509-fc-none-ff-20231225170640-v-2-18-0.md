description: JAK2V617F (JAK2VF) clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been associated with
  atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). We assessed the impact of Jak2VF
  CH on arterial thrombosis and explored the underlying mechanisms. A meta-analysis
  of three large cohort studies confirmed the association of JAK2VF with CVD, and
  with platelet counts and adjusted mean platelet volume (MPV). In mice, 20% or 1.5%
  Jak2VF CH accelerated arterial thrombosis and increased platelet activation. Megakaryocytes
  in Jak2VF ...
