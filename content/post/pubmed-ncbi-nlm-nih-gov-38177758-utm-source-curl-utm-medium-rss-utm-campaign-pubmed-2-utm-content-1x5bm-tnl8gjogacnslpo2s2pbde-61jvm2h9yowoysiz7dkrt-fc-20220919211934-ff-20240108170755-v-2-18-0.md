description: With the rapid generation of spatial transcriptomics (ST) data, integrative
  analysis of multiple ST datasets from different conditions, technologies and developmental
  stages is becoming increasingly important. Here we present a graph attention neural
  network called STAligner for integrating and aligning ST datasets, enabling spatially
  aware data integration, simultaneous spatial domain identification and downstream
  comparative analysis. We apply STAligner to ST datasets of the human ...
