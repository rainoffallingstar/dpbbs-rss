description: Regulation of viral RNA biogenesis is fundamental to productive SARS-CoV-2
  infection. To characterize host RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) involved in this process,
  we biochemically identified proteins bound to genomic and subgenomic SARS-CoV-2
  RNAs. We find that the host protein SND1 binds the 5' end of negative-sense viral
  RNA and is required for SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis. SND1-depleted cells form smaller
  replication organelles and display diminished virus growth kinetics. We discover
  that NSP9, ...
