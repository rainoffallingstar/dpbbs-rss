description: Platinum-based drugs remain the reference treatment for gastric cancer
  (GC). However, the frequency of resistance, due to mutations in TP53 or alterations
  in the energy and redox metabolisms, impairs the efficacy of current treatments,
  highlighting the need for alternative therapeutic options. Here, we show that a
  cycloruthenated compound targeting the redox metabolism, RDC11, induces higher cytotoxicity
  than oxaliplatin in GC cells and is more potent in reducing tumor growth in vivo.
