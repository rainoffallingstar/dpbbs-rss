description: The pathogenic, tropical Leishmania flagellates belong to an early-branching
  eukaryotic lineage (Kinetoplastida) with several unique features. Unfortunately,
  they are poorly understood from a molecular biology perspective, making development
  of mechanistically novel and selective drugs difficult. Here, we explore three functionally
  critical targeting short linear motif systems as well as their receptors in depth,
  using a combination of structural modeling, evolutionary sequence divergence ...
