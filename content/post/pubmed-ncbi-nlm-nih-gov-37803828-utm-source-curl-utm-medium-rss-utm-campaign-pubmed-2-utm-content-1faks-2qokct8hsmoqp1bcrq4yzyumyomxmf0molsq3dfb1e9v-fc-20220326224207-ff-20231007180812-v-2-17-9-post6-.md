description: Hydrodynamic flow in the spider duct induces conformational changes in
  dragline spider silk proteins (spidroins) and drives their assembly, but the underlying
  physical mechanisms are still elusive. Here we address this challenging multiscale
  problem with a complementary strategy of atomistic and coarse-grained Molecular
  Dynamics (MD) simulations with uniform flow. The conformational changes at the molecular
  level were analyzed for single-tethered spider silk peptides. Uniform flow leads
