  in public repositories, but derived information is often siloed according to data
  type, study or sampled microbial environment. Here we present SPIRE, a Searchable
  Planetary-scale mIcrobiome REsource that integrates various consistently processed
  metagenome-derived microbial data modalities across habitats, geography and phylogeny.
