description: For monogenic diseases caused by pathogenic loss-of-function DNA variants,
  attention focuses on dysregulated gene-specific pathways, usually considering molecular
  subtypes together within causal genes. To better understand phenotypic variability
  in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), we sub-categorized pathogenic DNA
  variants in ENG/endoglin, ACVRL1/ALK1, and SMAD4 if they generated premature termination
  codons (PTCs) subject to nonsense mediated decay. In three pre-phenotyped ...
