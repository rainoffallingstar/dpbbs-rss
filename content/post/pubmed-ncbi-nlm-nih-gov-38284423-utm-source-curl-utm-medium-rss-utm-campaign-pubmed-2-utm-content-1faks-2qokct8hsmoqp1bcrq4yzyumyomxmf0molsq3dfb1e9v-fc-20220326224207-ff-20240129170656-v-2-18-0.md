description: Pain sensitivity of healthy subjects in the cold-pressor (CP) test was
  proposed to be dichotomously distributed and to represent a pain sensitivity trait.
  Still, it has not been systematically explored which factors influence this pain
  sensitivity readout. The aim of this study was to distinguish potential contributions
  of local tissue-related factors such as perfusion and thermoregulation or gain settings
  in nociceptive systems. Cold-pressor-sensitive and CP-insensitive students screened
