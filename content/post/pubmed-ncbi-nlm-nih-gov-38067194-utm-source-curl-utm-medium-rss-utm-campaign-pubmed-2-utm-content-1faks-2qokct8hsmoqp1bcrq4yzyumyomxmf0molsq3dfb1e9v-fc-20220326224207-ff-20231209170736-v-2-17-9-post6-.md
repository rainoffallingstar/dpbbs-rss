description: The bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic system (HS) gives rise to blood cells
  originating from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), including megakaryocytes (MKs)
  and red blood cells (erythrocytes; RBCs). Many steps of the cell-fate decision remain
  to be elucidated, being important for cancer treatment. To explore the role of Wnt/β-catenin
  for MK and RBC differentiation, we activated β-catenin signaling in platelet-derived
  growth factor b (Pdgfb)-expressing cells of the HS using a Cre-lox ...
