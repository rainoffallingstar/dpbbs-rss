description: Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) is a common complication in newborns
  with Down syndrome (DS). It commonly progresses to myeloid leukemia (ML-DS) after
  spontaneous regression. In contrast to the favorable prognosis of primary ML-DS,
  patients with refractory/relapsed ML-DS have poor outcomes. However, the molecular
  basis for refractoriness and relapse, and the full spectrum of driver mutations
  in ML-DS remain largely unknown. We conducted a genomic profiling study of 143 TAM,
  204 ML-DS, ...
