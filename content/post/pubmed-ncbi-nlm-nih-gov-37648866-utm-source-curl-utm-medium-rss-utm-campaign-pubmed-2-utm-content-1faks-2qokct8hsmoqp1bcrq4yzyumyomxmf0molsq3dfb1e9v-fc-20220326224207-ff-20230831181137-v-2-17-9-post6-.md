description: Neptune-sized planets exhibit a wide range of compositions and densities,
  depending on factors related to their formation and evolution history, such as the
  distance from their host stars and atmospheric escape processes. They can vary from
  relatively low-density planets with thick hydrogen-helium atmospheres^(1,2) to higher-density
  planets with a substantial amount of water or a rocky interior with a thinner atmosphere,
  such as HD 95338 b (ref. ³), TOI-849 b (ref. ⁴) and TOI-2196 b (ref. ...
