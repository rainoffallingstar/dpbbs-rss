description: With the discovery that the acquisition of toxic features by extrasynaptic
  NMDA receptors (NMDARs) involves their physical interaction with the non-selective
  cation channel, TRPM4, it has become possible to develop a new pharmacological principle
  for neuroprotection, namely the disruption of the NMDAR/TRPM4 death signaling complex.
  This can be accomplished through the expression of the TwinF domain, a 57-amino-acid-long
  stretch of TRPM4 that mediates its interaction with NMDARs, but also ...
