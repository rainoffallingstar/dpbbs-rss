description: Autologous microsurgical breast reconstruction has become a standard
  of care. As techniques become more individualized and aim for less-invasive approaches,
  vessels ever smaller in diameter are considered for flap anastomosis. Robot-assisted
  surgery has great potential to reduce tremor and enhance precise motion. The Symani
