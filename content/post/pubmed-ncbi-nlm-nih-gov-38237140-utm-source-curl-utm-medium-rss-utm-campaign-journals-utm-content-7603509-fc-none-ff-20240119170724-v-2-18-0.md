description: Many patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) had decreased ectonucleotidase
  activity on neutrophils and platelets, which enabled extracellular nucleotides to
  trigger neutrophil-platelet aggregates. This phenotype was replicated by treating
  healthy neutrophils and platelets with patient-derived antiphospholipid antibodies
