description: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) parasite development in liver represents the
  initial step of the life-cycle in the human host after a Pf-infected mosquito bite.
  While an attractive stage for life-cycle interruption, understanding of parasite-hepatocyte
  interaction is inadequate due to limitations of existing in vitro models. We explore
  the suitability of hepatocyte organoids (HepOrgs) for Pf-development and show that
  these cells permitted parasite invasion, differentiation and maturation of ...
