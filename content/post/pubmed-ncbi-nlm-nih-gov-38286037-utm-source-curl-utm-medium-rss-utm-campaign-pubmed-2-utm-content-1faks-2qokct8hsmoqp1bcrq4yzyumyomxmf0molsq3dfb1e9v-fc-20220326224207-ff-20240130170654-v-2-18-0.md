description: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-α represents a key intracellular signal
  transducer involved in the regulation of key cell functions such as cell survival
  and proliferation. Excessive activation of PI3Kα is considered one of the major
  determinants of cancer therapy resistance. Despite preclinical and clinical evaluation
  of PI3Kα inhibitors in various tumor entities, including head and neck squamous
  cell carcinoma (HNSCC), it remains elusive how conventional radiochemotherapy can
