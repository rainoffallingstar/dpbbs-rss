description: Exocrine and endocrine pancreas are interconnected anatomically and functionally,
  with vasculature facilitating bidirectional communication. Our understanding of
  this network remains limited, largely due to two-dimensional histology and missing
  combination with three-dimensional imaging. In this study, a multiscale 3D-imaging
  process was used to analyze a porcine pancreas. Clinical computed tomography, digital
  volume tomography, micro-computed tomography and Synchrotron-based ...
