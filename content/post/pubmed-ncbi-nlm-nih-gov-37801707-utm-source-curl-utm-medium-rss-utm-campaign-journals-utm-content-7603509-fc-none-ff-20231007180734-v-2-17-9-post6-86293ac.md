  and the validation of surrogate markers could accelerate novel therapies. Although
  prognostic markers do exist, no surrogate markers have been validated in EMZL. We
  hypothesized that time to complete response within 24 months (TTCR24) and complete
  response at 24 months (CR24) could be valid surrogate markers of progression-free
  survival (PFS). The IELSG19 phase 3 trial showed the advantage of double ...
