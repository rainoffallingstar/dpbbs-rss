description: The mammary gland is a highly vascularized organ influenced by sex hormones
  including estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4). Beyond whole-organism studies in
  rodents or cell monocultures, hormonal effects on the breast microvasculature remain
  largely understudied. Recent methods to generate 3D microvessels on-chip have enabled
  direct observation of complex vascular processes; however, these models often use
  non-tissue-specific cell types, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
