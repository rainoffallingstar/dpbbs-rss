description: In the tumor milieu of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC),
  distinct B cell subpopulations are present, which exert either pro- or anti-tumor
  activities. Multiple factors, including hypoxia, cytokines, interactions with tumor
  cells, and other immune infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), alter the equilibrium between
  the dual roles of B cells leading to cancerogenesis. Certain B cell subsets in the
  tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibit immunosuppressive function. These cells are
