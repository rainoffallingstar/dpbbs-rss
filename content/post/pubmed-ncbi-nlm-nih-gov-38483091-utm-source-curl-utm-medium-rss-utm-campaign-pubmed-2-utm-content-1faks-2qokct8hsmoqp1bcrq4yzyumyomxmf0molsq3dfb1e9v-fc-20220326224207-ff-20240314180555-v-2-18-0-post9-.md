description: Recently, dithienopyrazines have emerged as promising building blocks
  in the field of materials science, showcasing their potential as hole-transport
  materials in organic electronic devices. Herein, we report the synthesis of its
  heavier analogues, the diselenopyrazines, along with an analysis of their optoelectronic
  and structural properties. In the acquired crystal structures, interesting molecular
  packing motifs suitable for potential device fabrication were observed. Additionally,
