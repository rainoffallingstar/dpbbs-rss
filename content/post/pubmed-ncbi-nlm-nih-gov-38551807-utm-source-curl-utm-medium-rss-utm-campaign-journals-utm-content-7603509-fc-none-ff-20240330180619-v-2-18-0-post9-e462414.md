description: Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is an antibody-drug conjugate that delivers
  calicheamicin to CD22-expressing cells. In a retrospective cohort of InO-treated
  patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we sought to understand the genomic
  determinants of response and resistance to InO. Pre- and post-InO patient samples
  were analyzed by whole genome, exome, and/or transcriptome sequencing. Acquired
  CD22 mutations were observed in 11% (3/27) of post-InO relapsed tumor samples, but
