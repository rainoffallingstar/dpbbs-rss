description: This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of AI in screening acute
  leukemia and its capability to classify either physiological or pathological cells.
  Utilizing an acute leukemia orientation tube (ALOT), one of the protocols of Euroflow,
  flow cytometry efficiently identifies various forms of acute leukemia. However,
  the analysis of flow cytometry can be time-consuming work. This retrospective study
  included 241 patients who underwent flow cytometry examination using ALOT between
