description: Asymptomatic Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 Gene (LRRK2) carriers are at
  risk for developing Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied presymptomatic substantia
  nigra pars compacta (SNc) regional neurodegeneration in asymptomatic LRRK2 carriers
  compared to idiopathic PD patients using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI technique (NM-MRI).
  Fifteen asymptomatic LRRK2 carriers, 22 idiopathic PD patients, and 30 healthy controls
  (HCs) were scanned using NM-MRI. We computed volume and contrast-to-noise ratio
