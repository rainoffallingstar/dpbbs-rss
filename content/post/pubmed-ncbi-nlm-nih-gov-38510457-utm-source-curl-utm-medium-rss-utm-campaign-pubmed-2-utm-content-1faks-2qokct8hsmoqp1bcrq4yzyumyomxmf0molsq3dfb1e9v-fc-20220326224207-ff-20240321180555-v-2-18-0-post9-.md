description: 'CONCLUSION: Inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) patients have the
  same risk factors for severe COVID-19 regarding comorbidities compared to the general
  population without any immune-mediated disease or immunomodulation. The use of rituximab
  was associated with an increased risk for severe COVID-19. On the other hand, the
  use of TNF-I was associated with less severe COVID-19 compared to the general population,
  which might indicate a protective effect of TNF-I against severe COVID-19 ...'
