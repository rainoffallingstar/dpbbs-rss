  monitored throughout their life cycle. Remote emission sensing (RES) is a technology
  that can measure emissions under real driving conditions without contact. Current
  light extinction based RES systems are capable of providing emission factors for
  various gases, but lack accuracy for particulate matter (PM). Point Sampling (PS)
