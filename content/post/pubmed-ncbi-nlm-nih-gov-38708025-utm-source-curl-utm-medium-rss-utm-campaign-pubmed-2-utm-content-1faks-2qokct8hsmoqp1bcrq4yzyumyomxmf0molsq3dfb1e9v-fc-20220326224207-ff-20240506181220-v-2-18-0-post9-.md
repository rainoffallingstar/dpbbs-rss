description: We develop new multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods to estimate the
  expectation of the smallest eigenvalue of a stochastic convection-diffusion operator
  with random coefficients. The MLMC method is based on a sequence of finite element
  (FE) discretizations of the eigenvalue problem on a hierarchy of increasingly finer
  meshes. For the discretized, algebraic eigenproblems we use both the Rayleigh quotient
  (RQ) iteration and implicitly restarted Arnoldi (IRA), providing an analysis of
  the cost ...
