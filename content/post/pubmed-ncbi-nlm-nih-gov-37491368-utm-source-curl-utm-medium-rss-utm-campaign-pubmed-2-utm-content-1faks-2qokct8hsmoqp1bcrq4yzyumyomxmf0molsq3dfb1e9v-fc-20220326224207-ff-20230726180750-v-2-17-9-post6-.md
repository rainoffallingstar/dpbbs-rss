description: Energy-coupling factor (ECF)-type transporters mediate the uptake of
  micronutrients in many bacteria. They consist of a substrate-translocating subunit
  (S-component) and an ATP-hydrolysing motor (ECF module) Previous data indicate that
  the S-component topples within the membrane to alternately expose the binding site
  to either side of the membrane. In many ECF transporters, the substrate-free S-component
  can be expelled from the ECF module. Here we study this enigmatic expulsion step
