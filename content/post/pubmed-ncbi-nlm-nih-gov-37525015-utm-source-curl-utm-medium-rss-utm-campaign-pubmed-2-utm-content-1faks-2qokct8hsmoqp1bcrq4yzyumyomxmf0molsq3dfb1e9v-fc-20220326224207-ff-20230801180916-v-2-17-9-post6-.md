description: Recent studies suggest that BRAF^(V600)-mutated melanomas in particular
  respond to dual anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and anti-cytotoxic T
  lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Here
  we identified an over-representation of interleukin (IL)-17-type 17 helper T (T(H)17)
  gene expression signatures (GES) in BRAF^(V600)-mutated tumors. Moreover, high baseline
  IL-17 GES consistently predicted clinical responses in dual-ICI-treated patient
  cohorts ...
