description: The mechanism of self-organization of chromatin subcompartments on the
  0.1-1 μm scale and their impact on genome-associated activities has long been a
  key aspect of research on nuclear organization. Understanding the underlying structure-function
  relationship, however, remains challenging due to the complex hierarchical structure
  of chromatin and the polymorphic organization of subcompartments that assemble around
  it. Towards this goal, approaches to measure local properties and ...
