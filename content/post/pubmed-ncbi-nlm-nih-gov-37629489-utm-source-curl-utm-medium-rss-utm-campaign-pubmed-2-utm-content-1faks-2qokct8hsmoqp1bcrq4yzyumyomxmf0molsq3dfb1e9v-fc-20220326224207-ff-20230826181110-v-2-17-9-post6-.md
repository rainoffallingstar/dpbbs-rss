description: Cancer multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the main mechanisms contributing
  to therapy failure and mortality. Overexpression of drug transporters of the ABC
  family (ATP-binding cassette) is a major cause of MDR. Extracellular vesicles (EVs)
  are nanoparticles released by most cells of the organism involved in cell-cell communication.
  Their cargo mainly comprises, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which are transferred
  from a donor cell to a target cell and lead to phenotypical changes. ...
