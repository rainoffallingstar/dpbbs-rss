description: The heterogeneity of tumors poses a challenge for understanding cell
  interactions and constructing complex ecosystems within cancer tissues. Current
  research strategies integrate spatial transcriptomics (ST) and single-cell sequencing
  (scRNA-seq) data to thoroughly analyze this intricate system. However, traditional
  deep learning methods using scRNA-seq data tend to filter differentially expressed
  genes through statistical methods. In the context of cancer tissues, where cancer
