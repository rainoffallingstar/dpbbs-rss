description: An efficient, highly selective and divergent synthetic method to construct
  2-substituted indoles and aryl-annulated carbazoles via the intermolecular generation
  of α-imino gold carbenes from terminal alkynes or diynes in combination with sulfilimines
  is disclosed. Importantly, the tandem reaction is proposed to proceed through an
  intermolecular gold carbene generation/ C-H annulation followed by the activation
  of a second alkyne leading to 6-endo-dig cyclization, which is significantly ...
