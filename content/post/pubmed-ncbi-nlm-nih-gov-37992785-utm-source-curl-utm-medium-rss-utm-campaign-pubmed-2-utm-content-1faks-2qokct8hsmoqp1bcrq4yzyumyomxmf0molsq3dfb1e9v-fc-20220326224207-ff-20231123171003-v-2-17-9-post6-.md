description: Cortical-striatal synaptic dysfunction, including enhanced toxic signaling
  by extrasynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (eNMDARs), precedes neurodegeneration
  in Huntington disease (HD). A previous study showed Activin A, whose transcription
  is upregulated by calcium influx via synaptic NMDARs, suppresses eNMDAR signaling.
  Therefore, we examined the role of Activin A in the YAC128 HD mouse model, comparing
  it to wild-type controls. We found decreased Activin A secretion in ...
