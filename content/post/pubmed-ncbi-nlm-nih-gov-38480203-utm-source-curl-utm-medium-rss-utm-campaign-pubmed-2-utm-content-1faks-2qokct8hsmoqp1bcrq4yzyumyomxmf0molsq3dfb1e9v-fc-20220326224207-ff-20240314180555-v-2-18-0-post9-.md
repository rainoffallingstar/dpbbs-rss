  a species described from central Costa Rica. However, while Helicops wettsteini
  has been considered in the literature a synonym of Hypsiscopus plumbeus (previously
  Enhydris plumbea), we present here morphological evidence for considering Helicops
  wettsteini a synonym of the recently described species Hypsiscopus murphyi Bernstein,
  Voris, Stuart, Phimmachak, Seateun, Sivongxay, Neang, Karns, Andrews, Osterhage,
