description: Singlet fission (SF) and its inverse, triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA),
  are promising strategies for enhancing photovoltaic efficiencies. However, detailed
  descriptions of the processes of SF/TTA are not fully understood, even in the most
  well-studied systems. Reports of the photophysics of crystalline rubrene, for example,
  are often inconsistent. Here we attempt to resolve these inconsistencies using time-resolved
  photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy of 'pristine' ...
