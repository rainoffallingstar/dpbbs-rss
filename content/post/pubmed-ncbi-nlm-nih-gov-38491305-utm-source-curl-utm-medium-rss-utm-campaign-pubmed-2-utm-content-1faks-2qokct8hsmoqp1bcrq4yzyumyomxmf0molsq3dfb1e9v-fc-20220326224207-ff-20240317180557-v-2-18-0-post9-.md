description: Thrombopoietin (Tpo), which binds to its specific receptor, the Mpl protein,
  is the major cytokine regulator of megakaryopoiesis and circulating platelet number.
  Tpo binding to Mpl triggers activation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and phosphorylation
  of the receptor, as well as activation of several intracellular signalling cascades
  that mediate cellular responses. Three tyrosine (Y) residues in the C-terminal region
  of the Mpl intracellular domain have been implicated as sites of ...
