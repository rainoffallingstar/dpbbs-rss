description: Loss of hepatic HNF4α expression is frequently observed in end-stage
  liver disease (ESLD) and associated with loss of vital liver functions and thus
  increases mortality. Loss of HNF4α expression is mediated by inflammatory cytokines
  such as TGF-β. However, details of how HNF4α is suppressed are largely unknown to
  date. This study reports that TGF-β does not directly inhibit HNF4α, but contributes
  to its transcriptional regulation by SMAD2/3 recruiting acetyltransferase CBP/p300
  to the ...
