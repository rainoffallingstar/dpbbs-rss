description: Omega-6 fatty acids are the primary polyunsaturated fatty acids in most
  Western diets, while their role in diabetes remains controversial. Exposure of omega-6
  fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in the generation of a highly reactive
  carbonyl species known as trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient
  detoxification of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive
  carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, ...
