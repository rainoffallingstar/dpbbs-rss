description: Personalized risk stratification and treatment may help improve outcomes
  among patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We developed a next-generation
  sequencing (NGS)-based method to assess a range of potential prognostic indicators,
  and evaluated it using pretreatment plasma samples from 310 patients with previously
  untreated DLBCL from the GOYA trial (NCT01287741). Variant calls and DLBCL subtyping
  with the plasma-based method were concordant with corresponding ...
