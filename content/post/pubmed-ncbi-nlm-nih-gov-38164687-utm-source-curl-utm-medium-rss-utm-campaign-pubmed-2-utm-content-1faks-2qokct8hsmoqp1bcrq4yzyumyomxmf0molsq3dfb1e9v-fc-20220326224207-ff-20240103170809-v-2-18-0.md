description: 'CONCLUSION: MAT showed good to excellent clinical results at a mean
  follow-up of 7 years. Low ICRS lesion grade was associated with a higher clinical
  and anatomic survival rate. Patients with concurrent OCA transplantation are at
  a higher risk of clinical and anatomic failure, but still report significantly improved
  PROMs. These results suggest that MAT has a lasting beneficial effect both in isolation
  and in complex cases with ≥1 concurrent ...'
