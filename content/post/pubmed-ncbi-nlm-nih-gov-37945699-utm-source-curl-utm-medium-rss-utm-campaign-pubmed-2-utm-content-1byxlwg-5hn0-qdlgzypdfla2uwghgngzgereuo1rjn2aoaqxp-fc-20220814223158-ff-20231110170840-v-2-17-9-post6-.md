description: Histopathological examination of tissue samples is essential for identifying
  tumor malignancy and the diagnosis of different types of tumor. In the case of lymphoma
  classification, nuclear size of the neoplastic lymphocytes is one of the key features
  to differentiate the different subtypes. Based on the combination of artificial
  intelligence and advanced image processing, we provide a workflow for the classification
  of lymphoma with regards to their nuclear size (small, intermediate, and ...
