description: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is associated with high mortality and
  costs, and frequently caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Although prior
  antimicrobial therapy is a major risk factor for HAP, the underlying mechanism remains
  incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that antibiotic therapy in hospitalized
  patients is associated with decreased diversity of the gut microbiome and depletion
  of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers. Infection experiments with mice ...
