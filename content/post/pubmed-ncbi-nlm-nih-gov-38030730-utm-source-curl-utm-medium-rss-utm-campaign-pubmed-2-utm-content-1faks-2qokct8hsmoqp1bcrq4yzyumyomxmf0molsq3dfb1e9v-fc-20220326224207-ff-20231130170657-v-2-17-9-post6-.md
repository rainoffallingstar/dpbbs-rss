description: The canonical picture of star formation involves disk-mediated accretion,
  with Keplerian accretion disks and associated bipolar jets primarily observed in
  nearby, low-mass young stellar objects (YSOs). Recently, rotating gaseous structures
  and Keplerian disks have been detected around several massive (M > 8 M(⊙)) YSOs
  (MYSOs)^(1-4), including several disk-jet systems^(5-7). All the known MYSO systems
  are in the Milky Way, and all are embedded in their natal material. Here we report
  the ...
