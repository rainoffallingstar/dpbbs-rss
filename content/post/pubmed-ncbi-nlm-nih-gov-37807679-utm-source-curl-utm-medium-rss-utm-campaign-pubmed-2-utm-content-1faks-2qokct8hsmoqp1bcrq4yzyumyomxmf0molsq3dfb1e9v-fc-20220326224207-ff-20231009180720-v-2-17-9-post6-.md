description: Little is known about the value of high-resolution follow-up imaging
  in patients with neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) and the question of the best treatment
  algorithm remains unclear. Three patients (one female, two male) with the clinical
  presentation of SARS-CoV-2-vaccination-associated NA underwent initial magnetic
  resonance neurography (MRN) imaging and follow-up examinations. All patients showed
  a marked clinical improvement, independent of treatment, including an almost full
