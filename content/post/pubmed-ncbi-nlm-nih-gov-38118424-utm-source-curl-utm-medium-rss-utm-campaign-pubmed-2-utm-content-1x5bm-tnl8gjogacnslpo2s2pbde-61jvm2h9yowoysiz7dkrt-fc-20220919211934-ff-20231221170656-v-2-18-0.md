description: Identification of the gene expression state of a cancer patient from
  routine pathology imaging and characterization of its phenotypic effects have significant
  clinical and therapeutic implications. However, prediction of expression of individual
  genes from whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to co-dependent or correlated
  expression of multiple genes. Here, we use a purely data-driven approach to first
  identify groups of genes with co-dependent expression and then predict their ...
