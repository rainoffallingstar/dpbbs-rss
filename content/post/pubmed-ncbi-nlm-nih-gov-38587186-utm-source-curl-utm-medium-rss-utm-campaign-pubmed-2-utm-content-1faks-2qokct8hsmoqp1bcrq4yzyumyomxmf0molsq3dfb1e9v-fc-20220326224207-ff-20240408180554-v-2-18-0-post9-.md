description: AT-rich interaction domain protein 1A (ARID1A), a SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
  complex subunit, is frequently mutated across various cancer entities. Loss of ARID1A
  leads to DNA repair defects. Here, we show that ARID1A plays epigenetic roles to
  promote both DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair pathways, non-homologous end-joining
  (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). ARID1A is accumulated at DSBs after DNA
  damage and regulates chromatin loops formation by recruiting RAD21 and CTCF ...
