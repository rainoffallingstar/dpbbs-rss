description: The chemistry of alkynyl triazenes is an emerging field for organic chemists
  and especially acid-induced nucleophilic functionalizations, either directly, or
  after a prior reaction towards aromatic triazenes under extrusion of nitrogen, paved
  the way for fruitful strategies. In contrast, the chemical behavior of alkynyl triazenes
  upon irradiation with light is still unknown. Herein we present the first photoactivation
  of alkynyl triazenes that triggers an uncommon reactivity pattern ...
