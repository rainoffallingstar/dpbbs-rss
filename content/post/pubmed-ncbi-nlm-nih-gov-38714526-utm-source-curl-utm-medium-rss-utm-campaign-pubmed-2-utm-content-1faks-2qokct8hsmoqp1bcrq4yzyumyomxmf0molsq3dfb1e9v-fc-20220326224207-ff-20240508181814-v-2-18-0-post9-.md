description: Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has emerged as a valuable tool to address
  RNA interference (RNAi) to modulate gene expression also in therapy. However, challenges
  such as inefficient cell targeting and rapid degradation in biological systems have
  limited its success. To address these issues, the development of a receptor-specific
  shuttle system represents a promising solution. [F⁷,P^(34)]-NPY analogues were modified
  by solid-phase peptide synthesis, enabling non-covalent conjugation with ...
