description: Mahvash disease is an exceedingly rare genetic disorder of glucagon signaling
  characterized by hyperglucagonemia, hyperaminoacidemia, and pancreatic α-cell hyperplasia.
  Although there is no known definitive treatment, octreotide has been used to decrease
  systemic glucagon levels. We describe a woman who presented to our medical center
  after three episodes of small-volume hematemesis. She was found to have hyperglucagonemia
