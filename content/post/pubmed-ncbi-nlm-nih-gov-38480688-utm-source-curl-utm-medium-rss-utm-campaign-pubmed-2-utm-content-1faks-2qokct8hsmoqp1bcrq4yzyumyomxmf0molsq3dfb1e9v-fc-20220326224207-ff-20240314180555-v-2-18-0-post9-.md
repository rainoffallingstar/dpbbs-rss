description: NME3 is a member of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) family localized
  on the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). Here, we report a role of NME3 in hypoxia-induced
  mitophagy dependent on its active site phosphohistidine but not the NDPK function.
  Mice carrying a knock-in mutation in the Nme3 gene disrupting NME3 active site histidine
  phosphorylation are vulnerable to ischemia/reperfusion-induced infarction and develop
  abnormalities in cerebellar function. Our mechanistic analysis ...
