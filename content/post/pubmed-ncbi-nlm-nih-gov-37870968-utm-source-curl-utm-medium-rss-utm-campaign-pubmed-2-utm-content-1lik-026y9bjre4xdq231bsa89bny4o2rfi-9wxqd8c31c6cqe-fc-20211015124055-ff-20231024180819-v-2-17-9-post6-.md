  EGFR inhibitor in patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer, both
  doses of sotorasib in combination with panitumumab resulted in longer progression-free
  survival than standard treatment. Toxic effects were as expected for either agent
  alone and resulted in few discontinuations of treatment. (Funded by Amgen; CodeBreaK
