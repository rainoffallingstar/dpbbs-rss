description: UBTF tandem duplications (UBTF-TDs) have recently emerged as a recurrent
  alteration in pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). UBTF-TD leukemias
  are characterized by a poor response to conventional chemotherapy and a transcriptional
  signature that mirrors NUP98-rearranged and NPM1-mutant AMLs, including HOX gene
  dysregulation. However, the mechanism of how UBTF-TD drives leukemogenesis remains
  unknown. In this study, we investigated the genomic occupancy of UBTF-TD in ...
