description: Percutaneous CT-guided biopsy is a frequently performed procedure for
  the confirmation and molecular workup of hepatic metastases of pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Tumor necrosis of primary PDAC has shown a negative prognostic
  impact in recent studies. This study aims to examine predictability in CT scans
  and the prognostic impact of necrosis in hepatic metastases of PDAC. In this tertiary-center
