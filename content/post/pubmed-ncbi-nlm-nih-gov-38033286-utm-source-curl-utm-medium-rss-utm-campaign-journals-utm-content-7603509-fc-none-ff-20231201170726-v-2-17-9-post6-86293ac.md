description: Cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) is essential for phagocytic
  clearance and blood clotting. Although a calcium-activated phospholipid scramblase
  (CaPLSase) has long been proposed to mediate PS exposure in red blood cells (RBCs),
  its identity, activation mechanism, and role in RBC biology and disease remain elusive.
  Here we demonstrate that TMEM16F, the long-sought-after RBC CaPLSase, is activated
  by calcium influx through the mechanosensitive channel PIEZO1 in RBCs. ...
