  in both preclinical and clinical studies, hereby relying on technologies like PHIP-SAH
  (ParaHydrogen-Induced Polarization-Side Arm Hydrogenation), SABRE (Signal Amplification
  by Reversible Exchange), and dDNP (dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization), with
  dDNP being applied in humans. A clinical dDNP polarizer has enabled studies across
