description: The c-MYC oncogene regulates multiple cellular activities and is a potent
  driver of many highly aggressive human cancers, such as leukemia and triple-negative
  breast cancer. The oxadiazole class of compounds has gained increasing interest
  for its anticancer activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular
  modes of action of a 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative (ZINC15675948) as a c-MYC inhibitor.
  ZINC15675948 displayed profound cytotoxicity at the nanomolar range in CCRF-CEM
