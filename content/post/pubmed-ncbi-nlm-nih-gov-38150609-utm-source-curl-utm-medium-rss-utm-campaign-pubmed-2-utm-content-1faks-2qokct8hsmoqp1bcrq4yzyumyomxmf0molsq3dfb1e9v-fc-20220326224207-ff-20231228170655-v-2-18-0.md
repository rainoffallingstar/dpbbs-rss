description: The integration of additive manufacturing technologies with the pyrolysis
  of polymeric precursors enables the design-controlled fabrication of architected
  3D pyrolytic carbon (PyC) structures with complex architectural details. Despite
  great promise, their use in cellular interaction remains unexplored. This study
  pioneers the utilization of microarchitected 3D PyC structures as biocompatible
  scaffolds for the colonization of muscle cells in a 3D environment. PyC scaffolds
  are fabricated ...
