description: Incidences of diseases treated with transplantation frequently peak at
  higher age. The contribution of age to total risk of transplantation has not been
  estimated amidst an aging society. We compare outcomes of 1,547 patients aged 70-79
  and 9,422 patients aged 60-69 transplanted 1998-2018 for myeloid, lymphoid and further
  neoplasia in Germany. To quantify the contribution of population mortality to survival,
  we derive excess mortality based on a sex-, year- and age-matched German population
