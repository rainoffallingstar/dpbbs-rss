description: Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized
  by clonal proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and is associated with
  an increased risk of thrombotic events (TEs). Established risk factors for TEs in
  patients with PV include advanced age, TE history, and elevated hematocrit. Whereas
  an association of TE with elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts has been suggested
  by retrospective studies, this relationship needs further validation. The ...
