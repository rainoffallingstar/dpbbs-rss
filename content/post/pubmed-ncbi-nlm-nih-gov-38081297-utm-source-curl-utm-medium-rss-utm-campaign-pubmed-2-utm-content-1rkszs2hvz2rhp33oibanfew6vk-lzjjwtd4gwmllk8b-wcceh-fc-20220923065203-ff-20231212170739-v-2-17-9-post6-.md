description: The scarcity of malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells hamper
  tissue-based comprehensive genomic profiling of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL).
  Liquid biopsies, in contrast, show promise for molecular profiling of cHL due to
  relatively high circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels^(1-4). Here, we show that the
  plasma representation of mutations exceeds the bulk tumor representation in most
  cases, making cHL particularly amenable to noninvasive profiling. Leveraging ...
