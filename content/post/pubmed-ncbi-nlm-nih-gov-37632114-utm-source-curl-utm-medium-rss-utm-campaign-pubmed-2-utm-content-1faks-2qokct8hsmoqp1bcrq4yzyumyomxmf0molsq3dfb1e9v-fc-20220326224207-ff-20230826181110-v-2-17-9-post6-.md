description: Bovine foamy virus (BFVbta) displays a very high degree of cell-associated
  replication which is unprecedented even among the other known foamy viruses. Interestingly,
  recent studies have shown that it can in fact adapt in vitro to high-titer (HT)
  cell-free transmission due to genetic changes acquired during repeated rounds of
  cell-free BFVbta passages in immortalized bovine MDBK cells. Molecular clones obtained
  from the HT BFVbta Riems cell-free variant (HT BFVbta Riems) have been ...
