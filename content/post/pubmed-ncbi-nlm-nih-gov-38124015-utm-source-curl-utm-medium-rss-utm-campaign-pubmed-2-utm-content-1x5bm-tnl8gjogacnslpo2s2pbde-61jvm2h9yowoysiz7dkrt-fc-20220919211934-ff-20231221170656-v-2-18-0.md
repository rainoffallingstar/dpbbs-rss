description: Opioid use disorder is a chronic, relapsing disease associated with persistent
  changes in brain plasticity. A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the
  mu-opioid receptor gene, OPRM1 A118G, is associated with altered vulnerability to
  opioid addiction. Reconfiguration of neuronal connectivity may explain dependence
  risk in individuals with this SNP. Mice with the equivalent Oprm1 variant, A112G,
  demonstrate sex-specific alterations in the rewarding properties of morphine and
  heroin. ...
