  (DCD) hearts with the novel Custodiol-N solution on diastolic and coronary microvascular
  dysfunction is unknown. Porcine DCD-hearts were maintained four hours by perfusion
  with normothermic blood (DCD-B), hypothermic Custodiol (DCD-C), or Custodiol-N (DCD-CN),
  followed by one hour of reperfusion with fresh blood, including microvascular and
