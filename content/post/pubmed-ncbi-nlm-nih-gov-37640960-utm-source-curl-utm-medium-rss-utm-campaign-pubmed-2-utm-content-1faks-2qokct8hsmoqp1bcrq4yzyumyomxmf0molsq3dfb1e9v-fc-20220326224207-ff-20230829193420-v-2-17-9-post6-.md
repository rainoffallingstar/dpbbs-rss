description: Diffusion models have been widely used to obtain information about cognitive
  processes from the analysis of responses and response-time data in two-alternative
  forced-choice tasks. We present an implementation of the seven-parameter diffusion
  model, incorporating inter-trial variabilities in drift rate, non-decision time,
  and relative starting point, in the probabilistic programming language Stan. Stan
