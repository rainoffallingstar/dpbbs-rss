description: Cellular signalling is a complex process and involves cascades of enzymes
  that, in response to a specific signal, give rise to exact cellular responses. Signalling
  scaffold proteins organise components of these signalling pathways in space and
  time to co-ordinate signalling outputs. In this review we introduce a new class
  of mechanically operated signalling scaffolds that are built into the cytoskeletal
  architecture of the cell. These proteins contain force-dependent binary switch domains
