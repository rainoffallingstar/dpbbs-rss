description: Effect sizes of psychotherapies currently stagnate at a low-to-moderate
  level. Personalizing psychotherapy by algorithm-based modular procedures promises
  improved outcomes, greater flexibility, and a better fit between research and practice.
  However, evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of modular-based psychotherapy,
  using a personalized treatment algorithm, is lacking. This proof-of-concept randomized
  controlled trial was conducted in 70 adult outpatients with a primary DSM-5 diagnosis
