description: Here, high-throughput tomography (HiTT), a fast and versatile phase-contrast
  imaging platform for life-science samples on the EMBL beamline P14 at DESY in Hamburg,
  Germany, is presented. A high-photon-flux undulator beamline is used to perform
  tomographic phase-contrast acquisition in about two minutes which is linked to an
  automated data processing pipeline that delivers a 3D reconstructed data set less
  than a minute and a half after the completion of the X-ray scan. Combining this
