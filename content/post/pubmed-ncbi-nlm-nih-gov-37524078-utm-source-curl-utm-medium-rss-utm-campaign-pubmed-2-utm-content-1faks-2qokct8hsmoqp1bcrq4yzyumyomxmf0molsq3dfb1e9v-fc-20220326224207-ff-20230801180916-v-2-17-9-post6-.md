description: The domino process of the palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction of isocyanides
  with 2H-azirine provides various tetrasubstituted pyrimidines via one C-C bond and
  two C-N bond formations with satisfactory yields. The title compounds are obtained
  with good functional group tolerance, high atom economy, and broad substrate ...
