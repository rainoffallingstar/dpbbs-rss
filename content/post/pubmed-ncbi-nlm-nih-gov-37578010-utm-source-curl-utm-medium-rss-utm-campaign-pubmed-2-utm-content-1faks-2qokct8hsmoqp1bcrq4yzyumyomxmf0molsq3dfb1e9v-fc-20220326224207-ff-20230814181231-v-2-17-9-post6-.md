description: Given the vital role of thyroid hormones (THs) in vertebrate development,
  it is essential to identify chemicals that interfere with the TH system. Whereas,
  among non-mammalian laboratory animals, fish are the most frequently utilized test
  species in endocrine disruptor research, e.g. in guidelines for the detection of
  effects on the sex hormone system, there is no test guideline (TG) using fish as
  models for thyroid-related effects; rather, amphibians are being used. Therefore,
