description: Epigenetic modulation of the cell-intrinsic immune response holds promise
  as a therapeutic approach for leukemia. However, current strategies designed for
  transcriptional activation of endogenous transposons and subsequent interferon type-I
  (IFN-I) response, show limited clinical efficacy. Histone lysine methylation is
  an epigenetic signature in IFN-I response associated with suppression of IFN-I and
  IFN stimulated genes, suggesting histone demethylation as key mechanism of reactivation.
