description: Adipose tissue stores excess energy and produces a broad range of factors
  that regulate multiple physiological processes including systemic energy homeostasis.
  Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) plays a particularly important role in glucose metabolism
  as its endocrine function underpins food uptake and energy expenditure. Caloric
  excess triggers VAT inflammation which can impair insulin sensitivity and cause
  metabolic deregulation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) that reside in the VAT ...
