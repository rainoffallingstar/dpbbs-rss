description: Key to our ability to increase recombinant protein production through
  secretion is a better understanding of the pathways that interact to translate,
  process and export mature proteins to the surrounding environment, including the
  supporting cellular machinery that supplies necessary energy and building blocks.
  By combining droplet microfluidic screening with large-scale CRISPR libraries that
  perturb the expression of the majority of coding and non-coding genes in S. cerevisiae,
  we ...
