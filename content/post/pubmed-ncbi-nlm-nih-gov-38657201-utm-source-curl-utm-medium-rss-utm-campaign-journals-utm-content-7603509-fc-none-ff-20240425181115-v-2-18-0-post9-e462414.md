description: Teclistamab, an off-the-shelf B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) × CD3
  bispecific antibody that mediates T-cell activation and subsequent lysis of BCMA-expressing
  myeloma cells, is approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory
  multiple myeloma (RRMM). As a T-cell redirection therapy, clinical outcomes with
  teclistamab may be influenced by patient immune fitness and tumor antigen expression.
  We correlated tumor characteristics and baseline immune profiles with clinical ...
