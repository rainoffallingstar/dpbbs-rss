description: Defective FAS (CD95/Apo-1/TNFRSF6) signaling causes autoimmune lymphoproliferative
  syndrome (ALPS). Hypergammaglobulinemia is a common feature in ALPS with FAS mutations
  (ALPS-FAS), but paradoxically, fewer conventional memory cells differentiate from
  FAS-expressing germinal center (GC) B cells. Resistance to FAS-induced apoptosis
  does not explain this phenotype. We tested the hypothesis that defective non-apoptotic
  FAS signaling may contribute to impaired B cell differentiation in ALPS. ...
