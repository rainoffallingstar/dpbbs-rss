description: To examine the comparative robustness of computed tomography (CT)-based
  conventional radiomics and deep-learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) to
  predict overall survival (OS) in HCC patients. Retrospectively, 114 HCC patients
  with pretherapeutic CT of the liver were randomized into a development (n = 85)
  and a validation (n = 29) cohort, including patients of all tumor stages and several
  applied therapies. In addition to clinical parameters, image annotations of the
  liver parenchyma ...
