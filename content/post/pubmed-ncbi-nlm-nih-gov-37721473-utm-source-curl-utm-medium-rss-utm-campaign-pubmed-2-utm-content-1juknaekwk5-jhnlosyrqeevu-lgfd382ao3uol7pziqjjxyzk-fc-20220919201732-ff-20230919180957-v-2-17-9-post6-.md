description: Anelloviridae and Human Pegivirus 1 (HPgV-1) blood burden have been postulated
  to behave as surrogate markers for immunosuppression in transplant recipients. Here,
  we assessed the potential utility plasma Torque teno virus (TTV), total Anelloviridae
  (TAV), and HPgV-1 load monitoring for the identification of allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation recipients (allo-HSCT) at increased risk of infectious
