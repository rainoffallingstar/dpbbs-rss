description: The hippocampus has been implicated in temporal learning. Plasticity
  within the hippocampus requires NMDA receptor-dependent glutamatergic neurotransmission.
  We tested the prediction that hippocampal NMDA receptors are required for learning
  about time by testing mice that lack postembryonal NMDARs in the CA1 and dentate
  gyrus (DG) hippocampal subfields on three different appetitive temporal learning
  procedures. The conditional knockout mice (Grin1^(ΔDCA1) ) showed normal sensitivity
