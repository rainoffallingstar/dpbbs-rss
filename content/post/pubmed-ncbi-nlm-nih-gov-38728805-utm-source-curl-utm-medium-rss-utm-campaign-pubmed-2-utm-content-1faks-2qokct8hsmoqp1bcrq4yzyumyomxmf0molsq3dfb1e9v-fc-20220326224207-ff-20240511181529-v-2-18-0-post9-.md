description: Discrimination of nitroarenes with hydrophobic dyes in a polar (H(2)O)
  environment is difficult but possible via a lab-on-chip, with polymeric dyes immobilized
  on paper or nylon membranes. Here arrays of 12 hydrophobic poly(p-phenyleneethynylene)s
  (PPEs), are assembled into a chemical tongue to detect/discriminate nitroarenes
  in water. The changes in fluorescence image of the PPEs when interacting with solutions
  of the nitroarenes were recorded and converted into color difference maps, ...
