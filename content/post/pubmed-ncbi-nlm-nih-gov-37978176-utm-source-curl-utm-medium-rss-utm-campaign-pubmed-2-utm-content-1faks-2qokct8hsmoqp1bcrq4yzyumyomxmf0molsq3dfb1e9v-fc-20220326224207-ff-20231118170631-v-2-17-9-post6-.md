description: Nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs) maintain the architecture of bacterial
  chromosomes and regulate gene expression. Thus, their role as transcription factors
  may involve three-dimensional chromosome re-organisation. While this model is supported
  by in vitro studies, direct in vivo evidence is lacking. Here, we use RT-qPCR and
  3C-qPCR to study the transcriptional and architectural profiles of the H-NS (histone-like
  nucleoid structuring protein)-regulated, osmoresponsive proVWX operon ...
