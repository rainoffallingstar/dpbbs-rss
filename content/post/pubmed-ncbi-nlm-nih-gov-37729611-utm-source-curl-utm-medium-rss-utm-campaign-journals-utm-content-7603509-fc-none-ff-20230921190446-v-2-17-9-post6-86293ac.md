description: The translocation t(11;14) occurs in 20% of multiple myeloma (MM) patients
  and results in the upregulation of CCND1. Nearly two-thirds of t(11;14) MM cells
  are BCL2 primed and highly responsive to the oral BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. While
  it is evident that this unique sensitivity to venetoclax depends on the BH3-proapoptotic
  protein priming of BCL2, the biology underlying t(11;14) MM dependency on BCL2 is
  poorly defined. Importantly, the epigenetic regulation of t(11;14) transcriptomes
  and ...
