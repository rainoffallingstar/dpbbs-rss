  remains a major challenge for acute myeloid leukemia immunotherapy. CAR T cells
  specific for the CD117 antigen can deplete malignant and healthy hematopoietic stem
  cells before consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
  in absence of cytotoxic conditioning. Here we exploit non-viral technology to achieve
  early termination of CAR T cell activity to prevent incoming graft rejection. ...
