description: T(2)-hyperintense lesions are the key imaging marker of multiple sclerosis
  (MS). Previous studies have shown that the white matter surrounding such lesions
  is often also affected by MS. Our aim was to develop a new method to visualize and
  quantify the extent of white matter tissue changes in MS based on relaxometry properties.
  We applied a fast, multi-parametric quantitative MRI approach and used a multi-component
  MR Fingerprinting (MC-MRF) analysis. We assessed the differences in the ...
