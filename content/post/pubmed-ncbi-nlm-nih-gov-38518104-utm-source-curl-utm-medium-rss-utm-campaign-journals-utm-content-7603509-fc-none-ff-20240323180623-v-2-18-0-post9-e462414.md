description: Given the poor outcome of refractory and relapsing T-ALL, identifying
  prognostic markers is still challenging. Using SNP-array analysis, we provide a
  comprehensive analysis of genomic imbalances in a cohort of 317 newly-diagnosed
  T-ALL patients including 135 children and 182 adults with respect to clinical and
  biological features and outcomes. SNP-array results identified at least one somatic
  genomic imbalance in virtually all T-ALL patients (~96%). Del(9)(p21) (~70%) and
