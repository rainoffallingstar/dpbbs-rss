description: The risk of developing severe COVID-19 rises dramatically with age. Schoolchildren
  are significantly less likely than older people to die from SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  but the molecular mechanisms underlying this age-dependence are unknown. In primary
  infections, innate immunity is critical due to the lack of immune memory. Children,
  in particular, have a significantly stronger interferon response due to a primed
