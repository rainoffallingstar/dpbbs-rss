description: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hypermutator phenotype caused by
  DNA mismatch repair deficiency. MSI has been reported in various human cancers,
  particularly colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancers. MSI is a promising biomarker
  for cancer prognosis and immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Several computational
  methods have been developed for MSI detection using DNA- or RNA-based approaches
  based on next-generation sequencing. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA ...
