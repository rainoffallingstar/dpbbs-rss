description: Circadian rhythms (CRs) are fundamental biological processes that significantly
  impact human well-being. Disruption of these rhythms can trigger insufficient neurocognitive
  development, insomnia, mental disorders, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic dysfunctions,
  and cancer. The field of chronobiology has increased our understanding of how rhythm
  disturbances contribute to cancer pathogenesis, and how circadian timing influences
  the efficacy of cancer treatments. As the circadian clock ...
