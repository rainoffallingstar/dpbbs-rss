description: Predicting the transcription factor binding site (TFBS) in the whole
  genome range is essential in exploring the rule of gene transcription control. Although
  many deep learning methods to predict TFBS have been proposed, predicting TFBS using
  single-cell ATAC-seq data and embedding attention mechanisms needs to be improved.
  To this end, we present IscPAM, an interpretable method based on deep learning with
