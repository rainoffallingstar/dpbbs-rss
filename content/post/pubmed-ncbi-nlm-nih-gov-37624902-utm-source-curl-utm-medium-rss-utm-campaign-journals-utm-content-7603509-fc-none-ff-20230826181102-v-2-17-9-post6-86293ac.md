description: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by hyperinflammation
  and multi-organ dysfunction. Infections, including the reactivation of viruses,
  contribute to significant disease mortality in HLH. While T and NK cell-driven immune
  activation and dysregulation are well described, limited data exist on the status
  of the B cell compartment and humoral immune function in HLH. We noted marked suppression
  of early B cell development in patients with active HLH. In vitro B ...
