description: Membrane transporters playing an important role in the passage of drugs,
  metabolites and nutrients across the membranes of the brain cells have been shown
  to be involved in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known
  about sex-specific changes in transporter protein expression at the brain in AD.
  Here, we investigated sex-specific alterations in protein expression of three ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) and five solute carriers (SLC) transporters in the prefrontal cortex
  of ...
