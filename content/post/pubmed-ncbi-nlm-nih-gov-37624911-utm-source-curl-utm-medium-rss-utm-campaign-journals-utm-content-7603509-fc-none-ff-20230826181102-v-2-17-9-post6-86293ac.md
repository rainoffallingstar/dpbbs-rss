description: Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTRv) is a rare autosomal dominant
  adult-onset disorder caused by point mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene encoding
  TTR, i.e., prealbumin. ATTRv survival ranges from 3 to 10 years, and peripheral
  nervous system and heart are usually the two main tissues affected, although central
  nervous system and eye may also be involved. As liver is the main TTR protein secretor
  organ, it has been the main target of treatments developed these last years, ...
