description: We report the first detection of a TeV γ-ray flux from the solar disk
  (6.3σ), based on 6.1 years of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)
  observatory. The 0.5-2.6 TeV spectrum is well fit by a power law, dN/dE=A(E/1 TeV)^{-γ},
  with A=(1.6±0.3)×10^{-12} TeV^{-1} cm^{-2} s^{-1} and γ=3.62±0.14. The flux shows
  a strong indication of anticorrelation with solar activity. These results extend
  the bright, hard GeV emission from the disk observed with Fermi-LAT, seemingly due
  to ...
