description: About 25% of melanoma harbor activating NRAS mutations, which are associated
  with aggressive disease therefore requiring a rapid antitumor intervention. However,
  no efficient targeted therapy options are currently available for patients with
  NRAS-mutant melanoma. MEK inhibitors (MEKi) appear to display a moderate antitumor
  activity and also immunological effects in NRAS-mutant melanoma, providing an ideal
  backbone for combination treatments. In our study, the MEKi binimetinib, cobimetinib
