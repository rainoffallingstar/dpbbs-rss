  to immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade. Adoptive cell therapies
  (ACT) including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic
  T cell therapy targeting glioma-associated antigens are an emerging field in glioma
  immunotherapy. However, imaging techniques for non-invasive monitoring of adoptively
  transferred T cells homing to the glioma microenvironment are currently lacking.
