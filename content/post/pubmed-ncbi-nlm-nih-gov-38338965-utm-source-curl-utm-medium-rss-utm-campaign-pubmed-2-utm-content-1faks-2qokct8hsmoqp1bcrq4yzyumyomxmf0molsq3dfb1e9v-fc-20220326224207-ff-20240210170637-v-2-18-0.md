description: A birthweight centile (BWC) below the 25th is associated with an elevated
  risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, particularly among males. This male vulnerability
  may stem from alterations in placenta-specific androgen signalling, a signalling
  axis that involves the androgen receptor (AR)-mediated regulation of target genes
  containing androgen response elements (AREs). In this study, we examined global
  and ARE-specific transcriptomic signatures in term male placentae (≥37 weeks of
  gestation) ...
