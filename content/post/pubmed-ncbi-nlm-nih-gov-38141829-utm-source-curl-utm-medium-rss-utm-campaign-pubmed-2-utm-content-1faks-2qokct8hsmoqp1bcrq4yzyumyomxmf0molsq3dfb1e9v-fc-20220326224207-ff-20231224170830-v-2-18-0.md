description: RAD51B-rearranged sarcomas are rare neoplasms that exhibit a heterogeneous
  morphology. To date, 6 cases have been reported all involving the uterus, including
  4 perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and 2 leiomyosarcomas (LMS). In
  this study, we describe the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features
  of 8 additional sarcomas with RAD51B-rearrangement, including the first extrauterine
  example. All patients were females with a median age of 57 at presentation. Seven
