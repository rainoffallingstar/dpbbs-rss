description: The RNA binding protein Hfq has a central role in the post-transcription
  control of gene expression in many bacteria. Numerous studies have mapped the transcriptome-wide
  Hfq-mediated RNA-RNA interactions in growing bacteria or bacteria that have entered
  short-term growth-arrest. To what extent post-transcriptional regulation underpins
  gene expression in growth-arrested bacteria remains unknown. Here, we used nitrogen
  (N) starvation as a model to study the Hfq-mediated RNA interactome ...
