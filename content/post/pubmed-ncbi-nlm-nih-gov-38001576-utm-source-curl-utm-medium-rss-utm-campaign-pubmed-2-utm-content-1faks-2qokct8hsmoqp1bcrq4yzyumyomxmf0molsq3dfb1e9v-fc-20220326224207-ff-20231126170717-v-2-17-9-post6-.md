description: We have previously shown that the extracellular matrix and basement membrane
  protein Nidogen1 (NID1) is secreted by more malignant, mesenchymal-like CRC cells
  and induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes the migration
  and invasion of less malignant, epithelial-like CRC cells. Here, we performed a
  comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of multiple datasets derived from CRC patients
  and showed that elevated expression of NID1 and the genes ITGA3, ITGB1, and ITGAV,
