description: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder driven by abnormal
  amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) levels. In this study, we investigated the role of presenilin-like
  signal peptide peptidase-like 2b (SPPL2b) in AD pathophysiology and its potential
  as a druggable target within the Aβ cascade. Exogenous Aβ42 influenced SPPL2b expression
  in human cell lines and acute mouse brain slices. SPPL2b and its AD-related substrate
  BRI2 were evaluated in the brains of App^(NL-G-F) knock-in AD mice and ...
