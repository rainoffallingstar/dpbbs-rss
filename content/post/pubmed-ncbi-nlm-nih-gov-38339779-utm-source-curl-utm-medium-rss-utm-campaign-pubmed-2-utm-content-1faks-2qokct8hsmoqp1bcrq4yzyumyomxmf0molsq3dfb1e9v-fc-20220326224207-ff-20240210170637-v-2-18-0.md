description: In 2021, Suwala et al. described Primary Mismatch Repair Deficient IDH-mutant
  Astrocytoma (PMMRDIA) as a distinct group of gliomas. In unsupervised clustering,
  PMMRDIA forms distinct cluster, separate from other IDH-mutant gliomas, including
  IDH-mutant gliomas with secondary mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. In the published
  cohort, three patients received treatment with an immune checkpoint blocker (ICB),
  yet none exhibited a response, which aligns with existing knowledge about the ...
