  confirmed pathologies in the long biceps tendon (LBT) and quantify the T2 values
  in healthy and pathological tendon substance. This study comprised eighteen patients
  experiencing serious shoulder discomfort, all of whom underwent magnetic resonance
  imaging, including T2 mapping sequences, followed by shoulder joint arthroscopy.
