description: During late adolescence, the brain undergoes ontogenic organization altering
  subcortical-cortical circuitry. This includes regions implicated in pain chronicity,
  and thus alterations in the adolescent ontogenic organization could predispose to
  pain chronicity in adulthood - however, evidence is lacking. Using resting-state
  functional magnetic resonance imaging from a large European longitudinal adolescent
  cohort and an adult cohort with and without chronic pain, we examined links between
