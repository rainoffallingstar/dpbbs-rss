description: Metastasis formation is a complex process, involving multiple crucial
  steps, which are controlled by different regulatory mechanisms. In this context,
  the contribution of cancer metabolism to the metastatic cascade is being increasingly
  recognized. This Review focuses on changes in lipid metabolism that contribute to
  metastasis formation in solid tumors. We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which
  lipids induce a pro-metastatic phenotype and explore the role of lipids in response
