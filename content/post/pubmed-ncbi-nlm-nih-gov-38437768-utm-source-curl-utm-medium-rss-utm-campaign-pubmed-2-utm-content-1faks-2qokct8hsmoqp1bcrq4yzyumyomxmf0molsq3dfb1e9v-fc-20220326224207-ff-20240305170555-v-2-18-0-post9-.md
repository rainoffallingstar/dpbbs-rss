description: Spastic Ataxias (SA) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders with
  combined pyramidal and cerebellar system affection, leading to an overlap phenotype
  between Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSP) and Cerebellar Ataxias (CA). Here we
  describe the generation of iPSCs from three unrelated patients with an ultra-rare
  subtype of SA caused by compound heterozygous mutations in POLR3A, that encodes
  the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III. iPSCs were reprogrammed from normal human
