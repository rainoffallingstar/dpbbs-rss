description: We have previously demonstrated that neuroinflammation by the adaptive
  immune system acts as a robust and targetable disease amplifier in a mouse model
  of Spastic Paraplegia, type 11 (SPG11), a complicated form of Hereditary Spastic
  Paraplegia (HSP). While we identified an impact of neuroinflammation on distinct
  neuropathological changes and gait performance, neuropsychological features, typical
  and clinically highly relevant symptoms of complicated HSPs, were not addressed.
  Here we show ...
