description: Despite the widely recognized importance of noncovalent interactions
  involving aromatic rings in many fields, our understanding of the underlying forces
  and structural patterns, especially the impact of heteroaromaticity, is still incomplete.
  Here, we investigate the relaxation processes that follow inner-valence ionization
  in a range of molecular dimers involving various combinations of benzene, pyridine,
  and pyrimidine, which initiate an ultrafast intermolecular Coulombic decay ...
