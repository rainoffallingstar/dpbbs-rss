description: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who are eligible for treatment-free
  remission (TFR) may still relapse after tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) cessation.
  There is a need for accurate predictors of outcome to enable patients with a favorable
  profile to proceed while avoiding futile attempts. Sensitive detection of residual
  disease in total leukocytes at treatment cessation is associated with relapse, but
  is not highly discriminatory, likely because it is a composite measure of ...
