description: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is primary liver cancer, frequently diagnosed
  at advanced stages with limited therapeutic options. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate
  target gene expression and through inhibitory competitive binding of miRNA influence
  cellular processes including carcinogenesis. Extensive evidence proved that certain
  miRNA's are specifically expressed in neoplastic tissues of HCC patients and are
  confirmed as important factors that can participate in the regulation of key ...
