description: Planets with radii between that of the Earth and Neptune (hereafter referred
  to as 'sub-Neptunes') are found in close-in orbits around more than half of all
  Sun-like stars^(1,2). However, their composition, formation and evolution remain
  poorly understood³. The study of multiplanetary systems offers an opportunity to
  investigate the outcomes of planet formation and evolution while controlling for
  initial conditions and environment. Those in resonance (with their orbital periods
