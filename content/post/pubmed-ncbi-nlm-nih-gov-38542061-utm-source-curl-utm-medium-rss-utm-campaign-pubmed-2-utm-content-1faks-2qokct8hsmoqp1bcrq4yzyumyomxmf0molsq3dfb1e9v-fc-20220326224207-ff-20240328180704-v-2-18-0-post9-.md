description: Naphthylisoquinoline (NIQ) alkaloids are rising as a promising class
  of secondary metabolites with pharmaceutical potential. NF-κB has already been recognized
  as a significant modulator of cancer proliferation and drug resistance. We have
  previously reported the mechanisms behind the cytotoxic effect of dioncophylline
  A, an NIQ monomer, in leukemia cells. In the current study, we have investigated
  the cytotoxic effect of jozimine A(2), an NIQ dimer, on leukemia cells in comparison
