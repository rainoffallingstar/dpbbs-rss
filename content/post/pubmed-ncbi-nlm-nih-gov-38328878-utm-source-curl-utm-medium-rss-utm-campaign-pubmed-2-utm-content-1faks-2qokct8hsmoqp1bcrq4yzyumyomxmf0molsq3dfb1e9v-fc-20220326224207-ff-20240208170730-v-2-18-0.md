description: Analytical equations like Richardson-Dushman's or Shockley's provided
  a general, if simplified conceptual background, which was widely accepted in conventional
  electronics and made a fundamental contribution to advances in the field. In the
  attempt to develop a (highly desirable, but so far missing) counterpart for molecular
  electronics, in this work, we deduce a general analytical formula for the tunneling
  current through molecular junctions mediated by a single level that is valid for
