description: Despite the immense success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer
  treatment, many tumors, including melanoma, exhibit innate or adaptive resistance.
  Tumor-intrinsic T-cell deficiency and T-cell dysfunction have been identified as
  essential factors in the emergence of ICB resistance. Here, we found that protein
  arginine methyl transferase 1 (PRMT1) expression was inversely correlated with the
  number and activity of CD8+ T cells within melanoma specimen. PRMT1 deficiency or
  inhibition ...
