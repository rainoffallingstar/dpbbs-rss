description: The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) efficiently transforms primary B cells.
  Here, we show that this process starts immediately after cellular exposure to infectious
  viral particles. Virus binding to B cells led to the activation of intracytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinases and STAT3. Tegument proteins within the virion in turn activated
  the p38-MK2 pathway upon cell entry, independently of the viral DNA. Engagement
  of STAT3 and p38/MK2, two pro-inflammatory pathways, was essential for expression
  of the key ...
