description: Cardiomyocytes activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) transcription
  factor ATF6 during pressure overload-induced hypertrophic growth. The UPR is thought
  to increase ER protein folding capacity and maintain proteostasis. ATF6 deficiency
  during pressure overload leads to heart failure, suggesting that ATF6 protects against
  myocardial dysfunction by preventing protein misfolding. However, conclusive evidence
  that ATF6 prevents toxic protein misfolding during cardiac hypertrophy is ...
