description: Idiopathic Multicentric Castleman Disease (iMCD) is a rare cytokine-driven
  disorder characterized by systemic inflammation, generalized lymphadenopathy and
  organ dysfunction. Here, we present an unusual occurrence of iMCD in identical twins
  and examined the immune milieu within affected lymphoid organs and the host circulation
  using multi-omic high-dimensional profiling. Using Stereo-seq spatial transcriptomic
  profiling, we performed unsupervised spatially-constrained clustering to ...
