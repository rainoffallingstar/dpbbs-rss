description: This study aimed to examine the intraocular tolerability of the epidermal
  growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab, when applied intravitreally, and its
  effect on axial elongation. Guinea pigs aged 2-3 weeks were subjected to bilateral
  plano glasses and bilateral lens-induced myopization (LIM) as a single procedure
  for group I (n = 8) and group II (n = 8), respectively. In the animals of group
  III (n = 8), group IV (n = 8), and group V (n = 8), the right eyes of the animals,
  in addition to ...
