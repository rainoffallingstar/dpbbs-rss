description: Endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy is crucial in the management of
  complications resulting from necrotizing pancreatitis. However, both real-time and
  visual-spatial information is lacking during the procedure, thereby jeopardizing
  a precise positioning of the endoscope. We conducted a proof-of-concept study with
  the aim of overcoming these technical difficulties. For this purpose, a three-dimensional
  (3D) phantom of a stomach and pancreatic necroses was 3D-printed based on spatial
