description: Embryonic development is remarkably robust, but temperature stress can
  degrade its ability to generate animals with invariant anatomy. Phenotypes associated
  with environmental stress suggest that some cell types are more sensitive to stress
  than others, but the basis of this sensitivity is unknown. Here, we characterize
  hundreds of individual zebrafish embryos under temperature stress using whole-animal
  single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify cell types and molecular programs
