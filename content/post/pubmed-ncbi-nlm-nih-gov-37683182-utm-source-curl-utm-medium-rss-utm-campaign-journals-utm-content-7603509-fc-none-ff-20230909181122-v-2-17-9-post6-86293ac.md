description: Platelets are key vascular effectors in hemostasis, with activation signals
  leading to fast recruitment, aggregation, and clot formation. The canonical process
  of hemostasis is well characterized and shares many similarities with pathological
  thrombus formation. However, platelets are also crucially involved in the maintenance
  of vascular integrity under both steady state and inflammatory conditions by ensuring
  blood vessel homeostasis and preventing microbleeds. In these settings, platelets
