description: To date, several studies on genomic events underlying medulloblastoma
  (MB) biology have expanded our understanding of this tumour entity and led to its
  division into four groups-WNT, SHH, group 3 (G3) and group 4 (G4). However, there
  is little information about the relevance of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
  mutations and their consequences across these. In this report, we describe the case
  of a female patient with MB and a mitochondriopathy, followed by a study of mtDNA
  variants in ...
