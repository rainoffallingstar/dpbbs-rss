description: Though the effect of the recently identified mitochondrial NAD+ transporter
  SLC25A51 on glucose metabolism has been described, its contribution to other NAD+-dependent
  processes throughout the cell such as ADP-ribosylation remains elusive. Here, we
  report that absence of SLC25A51 leads to increased NAD+ concentration not only in
  the cytoplasm and but also in the nucleus. The increase is not associated with upregulation
  of the salvage pathway, implying an accumulation of ...
