description: Protein glycosylation is an essential post-translational modification
  in all domains of life. Its impairment in humans can result in severe diseases named
  congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs). Most of the glycosyltransferases (GTs)
  responsible for proper glycosylation are polytopic membrane proteins that represent
