description: 'CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with AHREs detected by implantable devices,
  anticoagulation with edoxaban did not significantly reduce the incidence of a composite
  of cardiovascular death, stroke, or systemic embolism as compared with placebo,
  but it led to a higher incidence of a composite of death or major bleeding. The
  incidence of stroke was low in both groups. (Funded by the German Center for Cardiovascular
