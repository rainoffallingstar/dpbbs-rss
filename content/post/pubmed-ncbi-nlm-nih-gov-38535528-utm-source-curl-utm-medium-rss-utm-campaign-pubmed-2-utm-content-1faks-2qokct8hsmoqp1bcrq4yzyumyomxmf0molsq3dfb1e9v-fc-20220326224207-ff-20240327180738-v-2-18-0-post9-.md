description: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a devastating, potentially fatal
  T-lymphocyte malignancy affecting the skin. Despite all efforts, the etiology of
  this disease remains unknown. Infectious agents have long been suspected as factors
  or co-factors in CTCL pathogenesis. This review deals with the panel of bacterial
  and viral pathogens that have been investigated so far in an attempt to establish
  a potential link between infection/carriage and CTCL development. A special focus
