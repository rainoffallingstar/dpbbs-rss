description: Cellular cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) has emerged as a key method
  to unravel the spatial and structural complexity of cells in their near-native state
  at unprecedented molecular resolution. To enable quantitative analysis of the complex
  shapes and morphologies of lipid membranes, the noisy three-dimensional (3D) volumes
  must be segmented. Despite recent advances, this task often requires considerable
  user intervention to curate the resulting segmentations. Here, we present ColabSeg,
