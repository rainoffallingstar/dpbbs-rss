description: Binge drinking behavior in early adulthood can be predicted from brain
  structure during early adolescence with an accuracy of above 70%. We investigated
  whether this accurate prospective prediction of alcohol misuse behavior can be explained
  by psychometric variables such as personality traits or mental health comorbidities
  in a data-driven approach. We analyzed a subset of adolescents who did not have
  any prior binge drinking experience at age 14 (IMAGEN dataset, n = 555, 52.61% ...
