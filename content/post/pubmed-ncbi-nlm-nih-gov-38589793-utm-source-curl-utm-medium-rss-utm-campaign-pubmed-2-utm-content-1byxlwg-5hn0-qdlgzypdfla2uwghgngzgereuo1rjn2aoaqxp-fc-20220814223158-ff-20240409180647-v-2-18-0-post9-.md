description: The research focuses on the segmentation and classification of leukocytes,
  a crucial task in medical image analysis for diagnosing various diseases. The leukocyte
  dataset comprises four classes of images such as monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils,
  and neutrophils. Leukocyte segmentation is achieved through image processing techniques,
  including background subtraction, noise removal, and contouring. To get isolated
  leukocytes, background mask creation, Erythrocytes mask creation, and ...
