description: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is characterized by a huge heterogeneity at the
  molecular level. The RAS/RAF pathway is the most frequently mutated, in about 50%
  of the patients. However, these mutations are frequently subclonal, suggesting a
  secondary event. Since these genes are part of our routine next-generation sequencing
  (NGS) panel, we analyzed >10,000 patients with different plasma cell disorders in
  order to describe the RAS/RAF landscape. In this large cohort of patients, almost
  61% of ...
