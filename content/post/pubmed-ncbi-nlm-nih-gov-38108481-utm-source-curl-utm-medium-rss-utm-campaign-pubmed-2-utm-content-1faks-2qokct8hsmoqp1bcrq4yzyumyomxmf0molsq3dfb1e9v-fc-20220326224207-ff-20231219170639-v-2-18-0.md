description: The performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations crucially depends
  on both the integration timestep and the number of integration steps. We present
  an adaptive general-purpose framework to automatically tune such parameters based
  on a local loss function that promotes the fast exploration of phase space. We show
  that a good correspondence between loss and autocorrelation time can be established,
  allowing for gradient-based optimization using a fully differentiable set-up. The
