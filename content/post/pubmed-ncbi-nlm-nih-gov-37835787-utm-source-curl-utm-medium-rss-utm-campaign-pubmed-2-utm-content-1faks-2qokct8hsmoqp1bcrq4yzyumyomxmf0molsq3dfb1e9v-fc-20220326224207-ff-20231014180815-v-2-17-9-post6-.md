description: KRAS G12C mutation (mKRAS G12C) is the most frequent KRAS point mutation
  in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and has been proven to be a predictive biomarker
  for direct KRAS G12C inhibitors in advanced solid cancers. We sought to determine
  the prognostic significance of mKRAS G12C in patients with NSCLC using the meta-analytic
  approach. A protocol is registered at the International Prospective Register for
  systematic reviews (CRD42022345868). PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, ...
