description: The World Health Organization has developed target product profiles containing
  minimum and optimum targets for key characteristics for tests for tuberculosis treatment
  monitoring and optimization. Tuberculosis treatment optimization refers to initiating
  or switching to an effective tuberculosis treatment regimen that results in a high
  likelihood of a good treatment outcome. The target product profiles also cover tests
  of cure conducted at the end of treatment. The development of the ...
