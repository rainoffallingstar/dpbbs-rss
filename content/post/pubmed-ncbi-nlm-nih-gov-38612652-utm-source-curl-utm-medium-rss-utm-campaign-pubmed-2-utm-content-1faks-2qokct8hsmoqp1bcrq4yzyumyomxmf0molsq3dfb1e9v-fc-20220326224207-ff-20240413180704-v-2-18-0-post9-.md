description: Systemic sclerosis (SSc), a predominantly female-affected systemic autoimmune
  disease, requires tailored treatment strategies contingent on organ involvement
  and symptom severity. Given SSc's inflammatory nature, the involvement of the kynurenine
  pathway (KP) in its pathophysiology is underexplored. Our study aimed to investigate
  sex-related differences in KP activation among SSc patients and assess the impact
  of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and estimated glomerular ...
