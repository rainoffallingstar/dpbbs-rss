description: 'CONCLUSION: Based on the morphological features, immunophenotype, and
  molecular findings (DICER1 PVs, copy number, and DNA methylation profiles), we suggest
  that the two cases diagnosed as pure primary ovarian WT represent moderately to
  poorly differentiated Sertoli Leydig cell tumours (SLCTs), while the tumours arising
  in teratomas represent true WTs. It is possible that at least some prior cases reported
  as pure primary ovarian WT represent ...'
