description: The aim of this study was to investigate the comparative antiseizure
  activity of the l-enantiomers of d,l-fenfluramine and d,l-norfenfluramine and to
  evaluate the relationship between their concentration in plasma and brain and anticonvulsant
  activity. d,l-Fenfluramine, d,l-norfenfluramine and their individual enantiomers
  were evaluated in the mouse maximal electroshock seizure (MES) test. d,l-Fenfluramine,
  d,l-norfenfluramine and their individual l-enantiomers were also assessed in the
