description: Background and study aims The prognosis for pancreatic cancer remains
  poor. Molecular diagnostics and customized therapies are becoming increasingly important
  in clinical routine. Patient-derived, predictive model systems such as organoids
  have the potential to substantially increase the depth of information from biopsy
  material by functional and molecular characterization. We compared the extent to
