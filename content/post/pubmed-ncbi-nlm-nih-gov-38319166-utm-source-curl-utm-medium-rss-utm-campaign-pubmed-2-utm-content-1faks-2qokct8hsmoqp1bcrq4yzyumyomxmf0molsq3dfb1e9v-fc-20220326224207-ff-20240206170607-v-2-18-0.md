description: Background CT-guided high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (hereafter, HDR
  brachytherapy) has been shown to be safe and effective for patients with unresectable
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but studies comparing this therapy with other local-regional
  therapies are scarce. Purpose To compare patient outcomes of HDR brachytherapy and
  transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable HCC. Materials
  and Methods This multi-institutional retrospective study included ...
