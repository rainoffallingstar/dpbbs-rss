description: Thymic epithelial cells are indispensable for T cell maturation and selection
  and the induction of central immune tolerance. The self-peptide repertoire expressed
  by medullary thymic epithelial cells is in part regulated by the transcriptional
  regulator Aire (Autoimmune regulator) and the transcription factor Fezf2. Due to
  the high complexity of mTEC maturation stages (i.e., post-Aire, Krt10+ mTECs, and
  Dclk1+ Tuft mTECs) and the heterogeneity in their gene expression profiles (i.e.,
