description: The methyl-lysine reader protein SPIN1 plays important roles in various
  human diseases. However, targeting methyl-lysine reader proteins has been challenging.
  Very few cellularly active SPIN1 inhibitors have been developed. We previously reported
  that our G9a/GLP inhibitor UNC0638 weakly inhibited SPIN1. Here, we present our
  comprehensive structure-activity relationship study that led to the discovery of
  compound 11, a dual SPIN1 and G9a/GLP inhibitor, and compound 18 (MS8535), a SPIN1
