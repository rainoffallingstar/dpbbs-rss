description: This letter presents a measurement of the nuclear modification factor
  of large-radius jets in sqrt[s_{NN}]=5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions by the ATLAS experiment.
  The measurement is performed using 1.72 nb^{-1} and 257 pb^{-1} of Pb+Pb and pp
  data, respectively. The large-radius jets are reconstructed with the anti-k_{t}
  algorithm using a radius parameter of R=1.0, by reclustering anti-k_{t} R=0.2 jets,
  and are measured over the transverse momentum (p_{T}) kinematic range of 158<p_{T}<1000
