description: Various joint pathologies such as osteochondritis dissecans, osteonecrosis,
  rheumatic disease, and trauma, may result in severe damage of articular cartilage
  and other joint structures, ranging from focal defects to osteoarthritis (OA). The
  osteochondral unit is one of the critical actors in this pathophysiological process.
  New approaches and applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
  continue to drive the development of OA treatment. Hydrogel scaffolds, a component
