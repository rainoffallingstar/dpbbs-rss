description: APC was shown to release extracellular vesicles (EVs). APC bound to the
  EVs was thought to be responsible for cytoprotection. Our study demonstrates that
  the cytoprotective effects of APC-released EVs are independent of APC. APC-released
  EVs carry anti-inflammatory microRNAs in their ...
