description: The aim of this review is to stimulate readers to undertake appropriate
  investigations of the mechanism for a possible oxygen effect in FLASH. FLASH is
  a method of delivery of radiation that empirically, in animal models, appears to
  decrease the impact of radiation on normal tissues while retaining full effect on
  tumors. This has the potential for achieving a significantly increased effectiveness
  of radiation therapy. The mechanism is not known but, especially in view of the
  prominent role ...
