description: Pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is an aggressive blood
  cancer associated with poor therapeutic response and high mortality. Here we describe
  the development of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-driven mouse models of AMKL that recapitulate the
  phenotypic and transcriptional signatures of the human disease. We show that an
  activating Ras mutation that occurs in human AMKL increases the penetrance and decreases
  the latency of CBF2AT3-GLIS2-driven AMKL. CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and GLIS2 modulate ...
