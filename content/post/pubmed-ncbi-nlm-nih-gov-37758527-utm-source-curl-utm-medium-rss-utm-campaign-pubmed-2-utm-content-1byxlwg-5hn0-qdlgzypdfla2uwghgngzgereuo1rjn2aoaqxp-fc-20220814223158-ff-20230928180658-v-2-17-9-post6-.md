description: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B cell neoplasm characterized
  by the accumulation of aberrant monoclonal B lymphocytes. CLL is the predominant
  type of leukemia in Western countries, accounting for 25% of cases. Although many
  patients remain asymptomatic, a subset may exhibit typical lymphoma symptoms, acquired
  immunodeficiency disorders, or autoimmune complications. Diagnosis involves blood
  tests showing increased lymphocytes and further examination using peripheral blood
  smear and ...
