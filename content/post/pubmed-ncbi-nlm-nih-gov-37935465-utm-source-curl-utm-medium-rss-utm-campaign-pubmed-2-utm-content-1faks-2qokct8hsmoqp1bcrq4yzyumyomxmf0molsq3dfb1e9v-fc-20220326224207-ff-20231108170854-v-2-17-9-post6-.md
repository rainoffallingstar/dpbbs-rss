description: Protein-RNA complexes exist in many forms within the cell, from stable
  machines such as the ribosome to transient assemblies like the spliceosome. All
  protein-RNA assemblies rely on spatially and temporally coordinated interactions
  between specific proteins and RNAs to achieve a functional form. RNA folding and
  structure are often critical for successful protein binding and protein-RNA complex
  formation. RNA modifications change the chemical nature of a given RNA and often
  alter its ...
