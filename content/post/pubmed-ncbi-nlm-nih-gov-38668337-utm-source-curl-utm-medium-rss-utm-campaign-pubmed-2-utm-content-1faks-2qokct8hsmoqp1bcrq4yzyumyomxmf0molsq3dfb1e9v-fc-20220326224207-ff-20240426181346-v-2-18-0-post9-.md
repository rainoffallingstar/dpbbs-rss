description: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the development of non-alcoholic
  fatty liver (NAFL) and its progression to advanced liver diseases remain elusive.
  Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) loss, leading to elevated methylglyoxal (MG) and dicarbonyl
  stress, has been implicated in various diseases, including obesity-related conditions.
  This study aimed to investigate changes in the glyoxalase system in individuals
  with non-pathological liver fat. Liver biopsies were obtained from 30 individuals
