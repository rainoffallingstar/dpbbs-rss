description: Biorientation of chromosomes during cell division is necessary for precise
  dispatching of a mother cell's chromosomes into its two daughters. Kinetochores,
  large layered structures built on specialized chromosome loci named centromeres,
  promote biorientation by binding and sensing spindle microtubules. One of the outer
  layer main components is a ten-subunit assembly comprising Knl1C, Mis12C and Ndc80C
  (KMN) subcomplexes. The KMN is highly elongated and docks on kinetochores and ...
