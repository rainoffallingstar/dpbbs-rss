description: Purpose To describe the design, conduct, and results of the Breast Multiparametric
  MRI for prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Response (BMMR2) challenge. Materials
  and Methods The BMMR2 computational challenge opened on May 28, 2021, and closed
  on December 21, 2021. The goal of the challenge was to identify image-based markers
  derived from multiparametric breast MRI, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
  and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, along with clinical data for ...
