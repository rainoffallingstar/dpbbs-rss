description: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of clonally differentiated plasma
  cells. MM is almost always preceded by precursor conditions, monoclonal gammopathy
  of unknown significance (MGUS), and smoldering MM (SMM) through largely unknown
  molecular events. Genetic alterations of the malignant plasma cells play a critical
  role in patient clinical outcomes. Del(17p), t(4;14), and additional chromosomal
  alterations such as del(1p32), gain(1q) and MYC translocations are involved in active
  MM ...
