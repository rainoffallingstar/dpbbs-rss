description: Recent studies in aquatic environments have indicated that microbial
  methane production is not limited to strictly anoxic conditions and is widespread
  in the oxic water column. Based on recent investigations proposing linkage between
  the microbial turnover of methylphosphonate (MPn) and the widespread methane oversaturation
  in surface waters, we conducted an MPn/^(13)C-MPn tracer approach that combines
  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-stable isotope ratio
