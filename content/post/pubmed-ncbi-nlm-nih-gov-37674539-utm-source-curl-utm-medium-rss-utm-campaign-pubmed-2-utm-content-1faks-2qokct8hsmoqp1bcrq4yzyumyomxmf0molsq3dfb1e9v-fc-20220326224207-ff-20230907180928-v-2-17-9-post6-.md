description: Histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR1/2)
  are epigenetic regulators that play a key role in gene expression and metabolism.
  HDAC3 is a class I histone deacetylase that functions as a transcriptional co-repressor,
  modulating gene expression by removing acetyl groups from histones and non-histone
  proteins. NCoR1, on the other hand, is a transcriptional co-repressor that interacts
  with nuclear hormone receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated ...
