description: Glycoprotein (GP) Ibα is expressed on the surface of platelets and megakaryocytes
  and is anchored to the membrane skeleton by Filamin A (FlnA). Whilst GPIb and FlnA
  have fundamental roles in platelet biogenesis, the nature of this interaction in
  megakaryocyte biology remains ill-defined. We generated a mouse model expressing
  either human wild-type (WT) GPIbα (hGPIbaWT) or a FlnA-binding mutant (hGPIbaFW)
  and lacking endogenous mouse GPIbα. Mice expressing the mutant GPIbα transgene ...
