description: Nanopore long-read sequencing enables real-time monitoring and controlling
  of individual nanopores. This allows to enrich or deplete specific sequences in
  DNA sequencing in a process called "adaptive sampling". So far, adaptive sampling
  was not applicable to direct sequencing of RNA. Here, we show that adaptive sampling
  is feasible and useful for direct RNA sequencing, which has its specific technical
  and biological challenges. Employing a well-controlled in vitro transcript-based
  model ...
