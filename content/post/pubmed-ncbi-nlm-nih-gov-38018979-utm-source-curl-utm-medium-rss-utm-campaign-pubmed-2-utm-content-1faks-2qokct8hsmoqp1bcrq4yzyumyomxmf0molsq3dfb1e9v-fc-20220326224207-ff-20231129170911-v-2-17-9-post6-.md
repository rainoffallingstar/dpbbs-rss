description: This proof-of-concept study introduces a hybrid capture oligo panel for
  whole-genome sequencing of all six human pathogenic hepatitis A virus (HAV) subgenotypes,
  exhibiting a higher sensitivity than some conventional genotyping assays. The ability
  of hybrid capture to enrich multiple targets allows for a single, streamlined workflow,
  thus facilitating the potential harmonization of molecular surveillance of HAV with
  other enteric viruses. Even challenging sample matrices can be ...
