description: Nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis is a still enigmatic example of
  protein self-assembly. We now introduce several cross-reacting anti-Nup nanobodies
  for imaging intact nuclear pore complexes from frog to human. We also report a simplified
  assay that directly tracks postmitotic NPC assembly with added fluorophore-labeled
  anti-Nup nanobodies. During interphase, NPCs are inserted into a pre-existing nuclear
  envelope. Monitoring this process is challenging because newly assembled NPCs ...
