description: Previous research has shown that learning procedural tasks enhances REM
  sleep the following night. Here, we investigate whether complex motor learning affects
  sleep architecture. An experiment in which twenty-two subjects either learned a
  motor task (trampolining) or engaged in a control task (ergometer) was carried out
  in a balanced within-group design. After an initial laboratory adaptation night,
  two experimental nights were consecutive. The results indicate that learning a motor
  task had ...
