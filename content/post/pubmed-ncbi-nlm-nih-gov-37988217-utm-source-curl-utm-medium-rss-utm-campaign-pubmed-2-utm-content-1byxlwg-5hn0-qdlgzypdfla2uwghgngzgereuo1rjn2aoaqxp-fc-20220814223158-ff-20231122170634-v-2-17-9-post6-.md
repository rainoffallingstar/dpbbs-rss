  new therapeutic applications for existing drugs. In this study, we present DRGBCN,
  a novel computational method that integrates heterogeneous information through a
  deep bilinear attention network to infer potential drugs for specific diseases.
  DRGBCN involves constructing a comprehensive drug-disease network by incorporating
  multiple similarity networks for drugs and diseases. Firstly, we introduce a layer
