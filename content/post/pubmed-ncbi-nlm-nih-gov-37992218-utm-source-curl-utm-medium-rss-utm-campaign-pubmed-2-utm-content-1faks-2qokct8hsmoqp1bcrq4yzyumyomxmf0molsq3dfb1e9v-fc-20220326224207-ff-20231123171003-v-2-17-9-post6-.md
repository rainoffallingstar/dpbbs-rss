description: Primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (pHLH) is a life-threatening
  hyperinflammatory syndrome that develops mainly in patients with genetic disorders
  of lymphocyte cytotoxicity and X-linked lymphoproliferative syndromes. Previous
  studies with etoposide-based treatment followed by hematopoetic stem cell transplantation
  (HSCT) resulted in 50-59% 5-year survival. Contemporary data are lacking. We evaluated
  88 pHLH patients documented in the international HLH Registry between 2016-2021
