description: This study aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of singleton exome
  sequencing and subsequent research-based trio exome analysis in children with a
  spectrum of brain malformations seen commonly in clinical practice. We recruited
  children ≤ 18 years old with a brain malformation diagnosed by magnetic resonance
  imaging and consistent with an established list of known genetic causes. Patients
  were ascertained nationally from eight tertiary paediatric centres as part of the
