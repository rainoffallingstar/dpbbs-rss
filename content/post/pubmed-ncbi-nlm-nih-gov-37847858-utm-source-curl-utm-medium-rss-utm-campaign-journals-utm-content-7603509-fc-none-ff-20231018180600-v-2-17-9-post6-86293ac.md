description: Hematological malignancies like Burkitt lymphoma (BL), Hodgkin's lymphoma
  (HL) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cause significant morbidity in humans.
  A substantial number of these lymphomas, particularly, HL and DLBCLs have poorer
  prognosis due to their association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Our earlier studies
  have shown that EBV encoded nuclear antigen EBNA2 upregulates PD-L1 in DLBCL and
  BLs by downregulating miR-34a. Here, we investigated whether EBNA2 affects the ...
