  into the CNS in SNCSL patients. Local production of chemokines such as IP-10 may
  support CNS infiltration by CAR-T cells but also carry the potential of amplifying
  local toxicity. Future studies investigating numbers, phenotype, and function of
  CAR-T in the different body compartments of SNSCL patients receiving CAR-T will
  help to improve local delivery of "fit" and highly tumor-reactive CAR-T with low
