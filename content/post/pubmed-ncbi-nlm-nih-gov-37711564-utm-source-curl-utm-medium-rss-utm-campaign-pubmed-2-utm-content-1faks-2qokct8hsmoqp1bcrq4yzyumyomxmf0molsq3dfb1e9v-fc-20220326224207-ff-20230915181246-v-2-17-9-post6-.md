description: 'INTRODUCTION: Advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent
  risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Due to its unique uremia-derived
  pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and the limitations of using potentially harmful
  contrast agents, the best non-invasive approach to assess CAD in these patients
  remains unclear. We sought to investigate the accuracy, safety, and prognosis of
  patients with severe CKD undergoing dobutamine stress cardiac magnetic resonance
