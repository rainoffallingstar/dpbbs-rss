description: Selecting the most suitable alternative donor becomes challenging in
  severe aplastic anemia (SAA) when a matched sibling donor (MSD) is unavailable.
  We compared outcomes in SAA patients undergoing SCT from matched unrelated donors
  (MUD, n=1106), mismatched unrelated donors (MMUD, n=340), and haploidentical donors
  (Haplo, n=206) registered in the EBMT database (2012-2021). For Haplo-SCT, only
  those receiving post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) for graft-versus-host disease
