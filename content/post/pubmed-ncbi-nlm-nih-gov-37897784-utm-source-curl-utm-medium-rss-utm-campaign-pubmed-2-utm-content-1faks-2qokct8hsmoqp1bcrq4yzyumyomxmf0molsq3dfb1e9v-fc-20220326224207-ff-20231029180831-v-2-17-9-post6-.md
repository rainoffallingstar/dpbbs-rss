description: We present a general class of entanglement criteria for continuous variable
  systems. Our criteria are based on the Husimi Q distribution and allow for optimization
  over the set of all concave functions rendering them extremely general and versatile.
  We show that several entropic criteria and second moment criteria are obtained as
  special cases. Our criteria reveal entanglement of families of states undetected
  by any commonly used criteria and provide clear advantages under typical ...
