description: Although VEGF-B was discovered as a VEGF-A homolog a long time ago, the
  angiogenic effect of VEGF-B remains poorly understood with limited and diverse findings
  from different groups. Notwithstanding, drugs that inhibit VEGF-B together with
  other VEGF family members are being used to treat patients with various neovascular
  diseases. It is therefore critical to have a better understanding of the angiogenic
  effect of VEGF-B and the underlying mechanisms. Using comprehensive in vitro and
