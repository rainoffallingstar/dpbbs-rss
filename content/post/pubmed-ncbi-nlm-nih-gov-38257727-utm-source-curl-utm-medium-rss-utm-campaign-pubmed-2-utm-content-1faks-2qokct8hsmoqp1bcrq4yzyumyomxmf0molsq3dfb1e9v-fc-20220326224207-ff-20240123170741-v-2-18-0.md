description: Herpesvirus entry requires the coordinated action of at least four viral
  glycoproteins. Virus-specific binding to a cellular receptor triggers a membrane
  fusion cascade involving the conserved gH/gL complex and gB. Although gB is the
  genuine herpesvirus fusogen, it requires gH/gL for fusion, but how activation occurs
  is still unclear. To study the underlying mechanism, we used a gL-deleted pseudorabies
  virus (PrV) mutant characterized by its limited capability to directly infect ...
