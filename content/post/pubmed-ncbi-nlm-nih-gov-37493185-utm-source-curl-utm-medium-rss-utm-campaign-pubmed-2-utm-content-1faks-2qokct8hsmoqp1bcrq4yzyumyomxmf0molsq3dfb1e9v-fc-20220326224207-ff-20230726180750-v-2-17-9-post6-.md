description: CDC14, originally identified as crucial mediator of mitotic exit in budding
  yeast, belongs to the family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) that are present
  in most eukaryotes. Contradicting data have sparked a contentious discussion whether
  a cell cycle role is conserved in the human paralogs CDC14A and CDC14B but possibly
  masked due to redundancy. Subsequent studies on CDC14A and CDC14B double knockouts
  in human and mouse demonstrated that CDC14 activity is dispensable for ...
