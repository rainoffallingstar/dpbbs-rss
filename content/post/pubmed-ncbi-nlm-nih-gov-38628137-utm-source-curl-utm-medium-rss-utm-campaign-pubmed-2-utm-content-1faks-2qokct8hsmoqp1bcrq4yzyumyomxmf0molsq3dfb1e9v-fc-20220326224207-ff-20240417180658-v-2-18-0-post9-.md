description: The cyanobacterium Prochloron didemni, an obligate symbiont of different
  species of colonial ascidians, occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, produces
  a variety of cyclic peptides. These patellamide-type macrocycles lead to relatively
  stable dicopper(II) complexes that are extremely efficient carbonic anhydrase mimics,
  the most active model systems known so far. Importantly, it recently was shown that
  copper(II) is coordinated to patellamide derivatives in Prochloron cells. An ...
