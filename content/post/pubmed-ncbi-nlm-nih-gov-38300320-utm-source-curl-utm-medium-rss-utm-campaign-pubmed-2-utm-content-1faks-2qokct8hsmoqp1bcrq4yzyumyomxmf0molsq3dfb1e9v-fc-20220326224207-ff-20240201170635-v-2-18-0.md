description: Hexosylceramides (HexCer) are implicated in the infection process of
  various pathogens. However, the molecular and cellular functions of HexCer in infectious
  cycles are poorly understood. Investigating the enveloped virus Uukuniemi (UUKV),
  a bunyavirus of the Phenuiviridae family, we performed a lipidomic analysis with
  mass spectrometry and determined the lipidome of both infected cells and derived
  virions. We found that UUKV alters the processing of HexCer to glycosphingolipids
