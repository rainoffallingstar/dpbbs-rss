description: 'CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the volume of revascularisation for
  PAD increased significantly during the pandemic indicating that patients with PAD
  had significant deterioration of their condition during the pandemic. This is likely
  multifactorial; due to disruptions to standard provision of podiatry, vascular surgery
  and endocrinology services to these patients, a decline in overall health and changes
  in health-related behaviours due to restrictions and infection control methods ...'
