description: Intratumoral heterogeneity impacts the success or failure of anti-cancer
  therapies. Here, we investigated the evolution and mechanistic heterogeneity in
  clonal populations of cell models for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.
  To this end, we established barcoded models of luminal breast cancer and rendered
  them resistant to commonly applied first line endocrine therapies. By isolating
  single clones from the resistant cell pools and characterizing replicates of individual
  clones ...
