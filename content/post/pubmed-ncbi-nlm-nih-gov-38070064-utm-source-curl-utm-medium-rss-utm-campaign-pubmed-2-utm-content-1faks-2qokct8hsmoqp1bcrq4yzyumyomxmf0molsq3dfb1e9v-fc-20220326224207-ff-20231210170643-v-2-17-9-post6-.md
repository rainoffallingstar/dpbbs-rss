description: Arterial-venous malformations (AVMs) are direct connections between arteries
  and veins without an intervening capillary bed. Either familial inherited or sporadically
  occurring, localized pericytes (PCs) drop is among the AVMs' hallmarks. Whether
  impaired PC coverage triggers AVMs or it is a secondary event is unclear. Here we
  evaluated the role of the master regulator of PC recruitment, Platelet derived growth
  factor B (PDGFB) in AVM pathogenesis. Using tamoxifen-inducible deletion of Pdgfb
