description: Osteoarthritis is caused by degeneration of the cartilage, which covers
  the bone ends of the joints and is decorated with an oligolamellar phospholipid
  (PL) bilayer. The gap between the bone ends is filled with synovial fluid mainly
  containing hyaluronic acid (HA). HA and PLs are supposed to reduce friction and
  protect the cartilage from wear in joint movement. However, a detailed understanding
  of the molecular mechanisms of joint lubrication is still missing. Previously, we
  found that ...
