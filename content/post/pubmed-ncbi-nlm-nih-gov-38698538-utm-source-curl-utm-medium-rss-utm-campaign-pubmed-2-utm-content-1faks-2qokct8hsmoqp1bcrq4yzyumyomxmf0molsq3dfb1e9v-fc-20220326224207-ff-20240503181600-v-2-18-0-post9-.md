description: In the last decades, the development of high-throughput molecular assays
  has revolutionised cancer diagnostics, paving the way for the concept of personalised
  cancer medicine. This progress has been driven by the introduction of such technologies
  through biomarker-driven oncology trials. In this review, strengths and limitations
  of various state-of-the-art sequencing technologies, including gene panel sequencing
  (DNA and RNA), whole-exome/whole-genome sequencing and whole-transcriptome... ...
