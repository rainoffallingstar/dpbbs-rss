description: For many years, it has been known that VWF interacts with FVIII, collagen
  and platelets. In addition, the key roles played by VWF in regulating normal hemostasis
  have been well defined. However, accumulating recent evidence has shown that VWF
  can interact with a diverse array of other novel ligands. To date, more than 60
  different binding partners have been described, with interactions mapped to specific
  VWF domains in some cases. Although the biological significance of these VWF ...
