description: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) rely on a complex interplay
  of transcription factors (TFs) to regulate differentiation into mature blood cells.
  A heptad of TFs - FLI1, ERG, GATA2, RUNX1, TAL1, LYL1, LMO2 - bind regulatory elements
  in bulk CD34+ HSPCs. However, whether specific heptad-TF combinations have distinct
  roles in regulating hematopoietic differentiation remained unknown. We mapped genome-wide
  chromatin contacts (HiC, H3K27ac HiChIP), chromatin modifications ...
