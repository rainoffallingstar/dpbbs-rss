description: Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is defined by expansion and accumulation of
  neoplastic mast cells (MC) in the bone marrow (BM) and extracutaneous organs. Most
  patients harbor a somatic KIT D816V mutation, which leads to growth factor independent
  KIT activation and accumulation of MC. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is a pro-apoptotic
  and inflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in clonal selection of neoplastic
  cells. We found that KIT D816V increases expression and secretion of TNF. ...
