description: The structure of the cell nucleus of higher organisms has become a major
  topic of advanced light microscopy. So far, a variety of methods have been applied,
  including confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy, 4Pi, STED and localisation
  microscopy approaches, as well as different types of patterned illumination microscopy,
  modulated either laterally (in the object plane) or axially (along the optical axis).
  Based on our experience, we discuss here some application perspectives of ...
