  therapeutic strategies is one of the most challenging problems in biomedicine. Three-dimensional
  (3D) tumor spheroids, reflecting avascular microregions within a tumor, are an advanced
  in vitro model system to assess the curative effect of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy.
  Tumor spheroids exhibit particular crucial pathophysiological characteristics such
