description: A primary challenge of high-throughput imaging flow cytometry (IFC) is
  to analyze the vast amount of imaging data, especially in applications where ground
  truth labels are unavailable or hard to obtain. We present an unsupervised deep
  embedding algorithm, the Deep Convolutional Autoencoder-based Clustering (DCAEC)
  model, to cluster label-free IFC images without any prior knowledge of input labels.
  The DCAEC model first encodes the input images into the latent representations and
  then ...
