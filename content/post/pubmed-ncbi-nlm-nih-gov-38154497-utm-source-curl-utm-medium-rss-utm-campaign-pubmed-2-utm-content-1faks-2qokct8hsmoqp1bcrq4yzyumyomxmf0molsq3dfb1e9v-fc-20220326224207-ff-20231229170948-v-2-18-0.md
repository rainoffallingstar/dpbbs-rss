description: With more novel drugs being approved for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma
  (OC), the question remains to what extent patients benefit from anti-angiogenic
  treatment with bevacizumab, either in combination with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PAPR) inhibitors or as single-agent maintenance. As fibroblast growth factor receptors
  and their ligands (FGFRs/FGFs) are key players in angiogenic signaling and have
  been linked to resistance to several drugs, we investigated the prognostic or ...
