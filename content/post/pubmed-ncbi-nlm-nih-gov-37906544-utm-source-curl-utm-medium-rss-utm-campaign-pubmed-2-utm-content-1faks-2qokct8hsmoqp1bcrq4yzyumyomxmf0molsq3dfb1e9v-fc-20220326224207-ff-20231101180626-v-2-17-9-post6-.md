description: Locomotion is a complex task involving excitatory and inhibitory circuitry
  in spinal gray matter. While genetic knockouts examine the function of individual
  spinal interneuron (SpIN) subtypes, the phenotype of combined SpIN loss remains
  to be explored. We modified a kainic acid lesion to damage intermediate gray matter
  (laminae V-VIII) in the lumbar spinal enlargement (spinal L2-L4) in female rats.
