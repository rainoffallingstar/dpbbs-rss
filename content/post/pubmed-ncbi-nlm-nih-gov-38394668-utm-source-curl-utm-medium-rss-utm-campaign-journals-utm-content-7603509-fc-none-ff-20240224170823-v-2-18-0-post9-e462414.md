description: Treatment resistance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and suppression of
  the autologous immune system represent major challenges to achieve a cure in acute
  myeloid leukemia (AML). Although AML blasts generally retain high levels of surface
  CD38 (CD38pos), LSCs are frequently enriched in the CD34posCD38neg blast fraction.
  Here, we report that IFNγ reduces LSCs clonogenic activity and induces CD38 upregulation
  in both CD38pos and CD38neg LSC-enriched blasts. IFNγ-induced CD38 upregulation
  depends ...
