description: This article presents a novel theoretical perspective on the role of
  cognitive biases within the autism and schizophrenia spectrum by integrating the
  evolutionary and computational approaches. Against the background of neurodiversity,
  cognitive biases are presented as primary adaptive strategies, while the compensation
  of their shortcomings is a potential cognitive advantage. The article delineates
  how certain subtypes of autism represent a unique cognitive strategy to manage cognitive
  biases ...
