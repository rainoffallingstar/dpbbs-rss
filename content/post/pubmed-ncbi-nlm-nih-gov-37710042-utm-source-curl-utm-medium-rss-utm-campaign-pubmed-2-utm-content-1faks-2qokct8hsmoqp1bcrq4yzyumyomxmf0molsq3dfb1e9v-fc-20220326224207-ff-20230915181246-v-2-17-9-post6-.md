description: The vertebrate brain emerged more than ~500 million years ago in common
  evolutionary ancestors. To systematically trace its cellular and molecular origins,
  we established a spatially resolved cell type atlas of the entire brain of the sea
  lamprey-a jawless species whose phylogenetic position affords the reconstruction
