description: We present the measurements of all-particle energy spectrum and mean
  logarithmic mass of cosmic rays in the energy range of 0.3-30 PeV using data collected
  from LHAASO-KM2A between September 2021 and December 2022, which is based on a nearly
  composition-independent energy reconstruction method, achieving unprecedented accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals the position of the knee at 3.67±0.05±0.15 PeV. Below the knee,
  the spectral index is found to be -2.7413±0.0004±0.0050, while above the knee, it
