description: Direct RNA sequencing offers the possibility to simultaneously identify
  canonical bases and epi-transcriptomic modifications in each single RNA molecule.
  Thus far, the development of computational methods has been hampered by the lack
  of biologically realistic training data that carries modification labels at molecular
  resolution. Here, we report on the synthesis of such samples and the development
  of a bespoke algorithm, mAFiA (m⁶A Finding Algorithm), that accurately detects single
