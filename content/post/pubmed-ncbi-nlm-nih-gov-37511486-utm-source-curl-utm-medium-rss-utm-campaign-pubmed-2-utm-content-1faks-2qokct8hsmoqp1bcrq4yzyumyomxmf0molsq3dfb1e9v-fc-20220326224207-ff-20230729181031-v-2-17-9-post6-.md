description: 'Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced endothelial dysfunction occurs in
  various cardiovascular disorders. I/R injury is partially driven by the release
  of cytokines. Known for its use in senotherapy, the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib is
  able to block the release of cytokines. We investigated the effect of ruxolitinib
  on the cytokine release and endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in an in vitro
  model of I/R. Aortic segments of C57BL/6J mice (N = 12/group) were divided into
  three groups: control, ...'
