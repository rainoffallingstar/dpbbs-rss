description: Graph learning models have received increasing attention in the computational
  analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Compared with conventional
  deep neural networks, graph neural networks and language models have exhibited superior
  performance by extracting graph-structured data from raw gene count matrices. Established
  deep neural network-based clustering approaches generally focus on temporal expression
  patterns while ignoring inherent interactions at gene-level as well ...
