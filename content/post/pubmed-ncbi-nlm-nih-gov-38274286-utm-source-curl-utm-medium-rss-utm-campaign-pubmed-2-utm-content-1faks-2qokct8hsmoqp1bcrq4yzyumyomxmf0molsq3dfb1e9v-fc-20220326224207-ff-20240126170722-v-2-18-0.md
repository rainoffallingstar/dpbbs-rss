description: Aging is a complex process characterized by the gradual decline of physiological
  functions, leading to increased vulnerability to age-related diseases and reduced
  quality of life. Alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns have emerged as
  a fundamental characteristic of aged human skin, closely linked to the development
  of the well-known skin aging phenotype. These changes have been correlated with
  dysregulated gene expression and impaired tissue functionality. In particular, the
