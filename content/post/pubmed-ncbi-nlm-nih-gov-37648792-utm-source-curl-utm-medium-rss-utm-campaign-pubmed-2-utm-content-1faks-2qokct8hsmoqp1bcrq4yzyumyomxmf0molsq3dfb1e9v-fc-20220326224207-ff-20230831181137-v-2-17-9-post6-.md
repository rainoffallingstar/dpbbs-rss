description: Cerebral embolization is a known complication of transcatheter aortic
  valve implantation (TAVI) but the effect of the procedure on the ocular perfusion
  is currently unclear. Thus, we investigated post-procedural morphologic and perfusion
  changes of the retina and choroid, using optical coherence tomography angiography
  (OCTA) and color fundus photography (CFP) in a prospective cohort study. Ophthalmic
  examinations were conducted pre- and post-TAVI. OCTA images were analyzed quantitatively
