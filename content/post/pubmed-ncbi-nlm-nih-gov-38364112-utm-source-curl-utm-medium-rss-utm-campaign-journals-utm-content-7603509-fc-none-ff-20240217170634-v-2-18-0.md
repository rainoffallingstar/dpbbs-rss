description: Selection of patients with NPM1 mutated AML for allogeneic transplant
  in 1st complete remission (CR1-allo) remains controversial due to a lack of robust
  data. Consequently, some centres consider baseline FLT3-ITD an indication for transplant
  and others rely on measurable residual disease (MRD) status. Using prospective data
  from the UK NCRI AML17 and AML19 studies, we examined the impact of CR1-allo according
  to peripheral blood NPM1 MRD status measured by RT-qPCR after 2 courses of ...
