description: Early T-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL) is a unique
  subtype of immature T-ALL that was initially associated with a dramatically inferior
  prognosis as compared to non-ETP T-ALL (Not-ETP) when it was first described in
  2009. Analyses of larger patient cohorts treated with more contemporary regimens,
  however, have shown minimal survival differences between ETP and Not-ETP. In this
