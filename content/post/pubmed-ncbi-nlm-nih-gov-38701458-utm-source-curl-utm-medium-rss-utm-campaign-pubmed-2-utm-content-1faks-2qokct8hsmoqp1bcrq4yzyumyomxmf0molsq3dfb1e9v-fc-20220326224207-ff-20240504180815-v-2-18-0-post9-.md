description: The first measurement of the cross section for incoherent photonuclear
  production of J/ψ vector mesons as a function of the Mandelstam |t| variable is
  presented. The measurement was carried out with the ALICE detector at midrapidity,
  |y|<0.8, using ultraperipheral collisions of Pb nuclei at a center-of-mass energy
  per nucleon pair of sqrt[s_{NN}]=5.02 TeV. This rapidity interval corresponds to
  a Bjorken-x range (0.3-1.4)×10^{-3}. Cross sections are given in five |t| intervals
  in the ...
