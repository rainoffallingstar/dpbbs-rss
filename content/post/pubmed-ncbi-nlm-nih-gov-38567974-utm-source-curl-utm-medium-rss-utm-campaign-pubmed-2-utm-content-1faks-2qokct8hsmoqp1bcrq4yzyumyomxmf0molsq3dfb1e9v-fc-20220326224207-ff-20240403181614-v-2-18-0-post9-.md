description: The key to a curative treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
  is the eradication of the intranuclear episomal covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA),
  the stable persistence reservoir of HBV. Currently, established therapies can only
  limit HBV replication but fail to tackle the cccDNA. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches
  toward curative treatment are urgently needed. Recent publications indicated a strong
