description: Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 22 (USP22) is a deubiquitinating enzyme
  (DUB) that underlies tumorigenicity, proliferation, cell death and differentiation
  through deubiquitination of histone and non-histone targets. Ubiquitination determines
  stability, localization and functions of cell fate proteins and controls cell-protective
  signaling pathways to surveil cell cycle progression. In a variety of carcinomas,
