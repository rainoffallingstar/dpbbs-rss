description: Cancer immunotherapies have demonstrated remarkable success; however,
  the majority of patients do not respond or develop resistance. Here, we conduct
  epigenetic gene-targeted CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify epigenomic factors that
  limit CD8^(+) T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. We identify that PRMT1 suppresses
  interferon gamma (Ifnγ)-induced MHC-I expression, thus dampening CD8^(+) T cell-mediated
  killing. Indeed, PRMT1 knockout or pharmacological targeting of type I PRMT with
