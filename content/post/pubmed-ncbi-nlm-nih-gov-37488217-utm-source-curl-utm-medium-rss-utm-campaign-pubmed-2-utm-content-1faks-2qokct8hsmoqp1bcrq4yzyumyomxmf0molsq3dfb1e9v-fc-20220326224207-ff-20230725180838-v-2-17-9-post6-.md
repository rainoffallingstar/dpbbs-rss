description: The miR-34a and miR-34b/c encoding genes represent direct targets of
  the p53 transcription factor, and presumably mediate part of the tumor suppressive
  effects of p53. Here, we sought to determine their functional relevance by inactivating
  miR-34a and/or miR-34b/c using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach in the colorectal cancer (CRC)
  cell line HCT116. Concomitant deletion of miR-34a and miR-34b/c resulted in significantly
  reduced suppression of proliferation after p53 activation, enhanced ...
