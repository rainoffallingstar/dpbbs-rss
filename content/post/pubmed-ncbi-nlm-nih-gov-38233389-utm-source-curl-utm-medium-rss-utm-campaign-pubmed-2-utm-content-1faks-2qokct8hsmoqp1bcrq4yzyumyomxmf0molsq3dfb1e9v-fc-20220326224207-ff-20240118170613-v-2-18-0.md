description: Unbiased phenotypic screens in patient-relevant disease models offer
  the potential to detect therapeutic targets for rare diseases. In this study, we
  developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify molecules that correct aberrant
  protein trafficking in adapter protein complex 4 (AP-4) deficiency, a rare but prototypical
  form of childhood-onset hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by mislocalization
  of the autophagy protein ATG9A. Using high-content microscopy and an ...
