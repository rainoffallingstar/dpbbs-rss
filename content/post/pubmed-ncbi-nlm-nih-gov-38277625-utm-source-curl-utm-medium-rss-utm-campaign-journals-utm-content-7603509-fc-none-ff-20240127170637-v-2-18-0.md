description: Acquired aplastic anemia is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized
  by hypocellular bone marrow and peripheral blood pancytopenia. Frequent clinical
  responses to calcineurin inhibition and anti-thymocyte globulin strongly suggest
  critical roles for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell-reactive T cell clones in
  disease pathophysiology; however, their exact contribution and antigen specificities
  remain unclear. We determined differentiation states and targets of dominant T cell
  clones ...
