description: Transcription initiation is a process that is essential to ensuring the
  proper function of any gene, yet we still lack a unified understanding of sequence
  patterns and rules that explain most transcription start sites in the human genome.
  By predicting transcription initiation at base-pair resolution from sequences with
  a deep learning-inspired explainable model called Puffin, we show that a small set
  of simple rules can explain transcription initiation at most human promoters. We
