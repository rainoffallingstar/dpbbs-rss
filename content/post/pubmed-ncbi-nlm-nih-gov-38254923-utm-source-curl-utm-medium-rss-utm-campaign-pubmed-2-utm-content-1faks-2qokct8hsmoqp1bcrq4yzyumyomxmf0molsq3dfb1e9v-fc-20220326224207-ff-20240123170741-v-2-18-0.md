description: The specific characteristics of k-mer words (2 ≤ k ≤ 11) regarding genomic
  distribution and evolutionary conservation were recently found. Among them are,
  in high abundance, words with a tandem repeat structure (repeat unit length of 1
  bp to 3 bp). Furthermore, there seems to be a class of extremely short tandem repeats
  (≤12 bp), so far overlooked, that are non-random-distributed and, therefore, may
  play a crucial role in the functioning of the genome. In the following article,
