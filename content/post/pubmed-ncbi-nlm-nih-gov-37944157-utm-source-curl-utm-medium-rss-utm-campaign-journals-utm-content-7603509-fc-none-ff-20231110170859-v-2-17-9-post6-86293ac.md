description: Non-muscle cell contractility is an essential feature underlying diverse
  cellular processes such as motility, morphogenesis, division and genome replication,
  intracellular transport, and secretion. Blood clot contraction is a well-studied
  process driven by contracting platelets. Megakaryocytes, which are the precursors
  to platelets, can be found in the bone marrow and in the lungs. Although they express
  many of the same proteins and structures found in platelets, little is known about
