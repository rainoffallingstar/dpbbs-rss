description: Velocity map imaging (VMI) is a powerful technique to deduce the kinetic
  energy of ions or electrons that are produced from a large volume in space with
  good resolution. The size of the acceptance volume is determined by the spherical
  aberrations of the ion optical system. Here we present an analytical derivation
  for velocity map imaging with no spherical aberrations. We will discuss a particular
  example for the implementation of the technique that allows using the reaction microscope
