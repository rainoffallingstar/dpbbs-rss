description: The ketogenic diet (KD) is a low-carb diet that has been indicated as
  a possible coadjuvant in cancer therapy, mainly due to its capacity to reduce glycolysis
  production, inflammation, and oxidative stress. However, KD's role in metastasis
  remains poorly explored. This study aims to provide a critical review of the literature
  about KD's efficacy in metastasis therapy and the possible molecular mechanisms
  behind it. Initially, general concepts on KD and metastasis are discussed. Then,
