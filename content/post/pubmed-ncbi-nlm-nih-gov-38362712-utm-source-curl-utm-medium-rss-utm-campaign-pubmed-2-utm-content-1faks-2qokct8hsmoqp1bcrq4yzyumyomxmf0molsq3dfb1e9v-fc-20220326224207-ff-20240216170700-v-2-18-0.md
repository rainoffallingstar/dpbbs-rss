description: Aryl-substituted alkanethiolate (AT) self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
  exhibit typically so-called odd-even effects, viz. systematic variations in the
  film structure, packing density, and molecular inclination depending on the parity
  of the number of the methylene units in the alkyl linker, n. As an exception to
  this rule, ATs carrying an anthracen-2-yl group (Ant-n) as tail group were reported
  to have different behavior due the non-symmetric attachment of the anthracene unit
  to the AT ...
