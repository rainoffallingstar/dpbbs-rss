  both mesothelial and endothelial cells, mitigating spheroid formation and gel contraction.
  On the contrary, effects on 2D phenotypes are more uniform in the icodextrin and
  amino acid PDF as opposed to glucose ones and affect mesothelial cells more variably.

  cell barriers, the mesothelial and endothelial, could provide useful ...'
