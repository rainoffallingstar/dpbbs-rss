description: The rapid growth of cultural evolutionary science, its expansion into
  numerous fields, its use of diverse methods, and several conceptual problems have
  outpaced corollary developments in theory and philosophy of science. This has led
  to concern, exemplified in results from a recent survey conducted with members of
  the Cultural Evolution Society, that the field lacks 'knowledge synthesis', is poorly
  supported by 'theory', has an ambiguous relation to biological evolution and uses
  key terms ...
