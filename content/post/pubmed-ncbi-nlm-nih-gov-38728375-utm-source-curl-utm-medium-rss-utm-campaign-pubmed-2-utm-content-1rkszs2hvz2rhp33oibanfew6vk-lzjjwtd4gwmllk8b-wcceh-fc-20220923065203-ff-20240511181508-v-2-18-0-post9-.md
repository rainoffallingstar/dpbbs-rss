description: Measurable residual disease (MRD) evaluation by multiparameter flow cytometry
  (MFC) or quantitative PCR methods is an established standard of care for assessing
  risk of relapse prior to or after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute
  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Next generation sequencing (NGS)-MRD has emerged as
  a highly effective approach that allows detection of lymphoblasts at a level of
  fewer than 1 in 106 nucleated cells, increasing sensitivity of ALL detection by
  2-3 ...
