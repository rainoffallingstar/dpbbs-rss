description: The myeloid neoplasms encompass acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic
  syndromes and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Most cases arise from the shared ancestor
  of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Here we analyze data from 454,340 UK Biobank participants,
  of whom 1,808 developed a myeloid neoplasm 0-15 years after recruitment. We describe
  the differences in CH mutational landscapes and hematology/biochemistry test parameters
  among individuals that later develop myeloid neoplasms (pre-MN) versus ...
