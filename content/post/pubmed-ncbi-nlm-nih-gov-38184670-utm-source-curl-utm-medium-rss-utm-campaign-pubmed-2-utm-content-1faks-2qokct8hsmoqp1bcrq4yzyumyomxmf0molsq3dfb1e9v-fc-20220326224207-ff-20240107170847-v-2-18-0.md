description: In 70 patients with KIT D816V positive systemic mastocytosis (SM) including
  36 patients with advanced SM (AdvSM), we correlated the extent of reported mucosal
  mast cell ([m]MC) infiltration of the upper and/or lower gastrointestinal tract
  (UGIT, n = 63; LGIT, n = 64; both, n = 57) with symptoms and markers of MC burden/subtype.
  GI symptoms were reported by all patients (mean 2.1 number of symptoms). A strong
  mMC infiltration was identified in 24 patients (UGIT, 17/63, 27%; LGIT, 19/64, ...
