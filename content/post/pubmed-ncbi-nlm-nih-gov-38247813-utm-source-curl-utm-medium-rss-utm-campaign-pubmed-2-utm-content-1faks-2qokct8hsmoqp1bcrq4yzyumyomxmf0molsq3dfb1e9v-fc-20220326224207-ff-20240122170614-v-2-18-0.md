description: '(1) Background: The chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin exerts toxic side
  effects causing acute kidney injury. Mesenchymal stromal cells can ameliorate cisplatin-induced
  kidney injury. We hypothesize that the MSC secretome orchestrates the vicious cycle
  of injury and inflammation by acting on proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs)
  and macrophages individually, but further by counteracting their cellular crosstalk.
