description: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most aggressive
  solid tumors with a dismal prognosis and an increasing incidence. At the time of
  diagnosis, more than 85% of patients are in an unresectable stage. For these patients,
  chemotherapy can prolong survival by only a few months. Unfortunately, in recent
  decades, no groundbreaking therapies have emerged for PDAC, thus raising the question
  of how to identify novel therapeutic druggable targets to improve prognosis. ...
