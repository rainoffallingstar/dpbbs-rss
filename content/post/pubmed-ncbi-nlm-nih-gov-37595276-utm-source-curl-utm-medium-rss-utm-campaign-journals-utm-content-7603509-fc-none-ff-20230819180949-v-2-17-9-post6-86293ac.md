description: Understanding the genetic alterations, disrupted signaling pathways,
  and hijacked mechanisms in oncogene-transformed hematologic cells is critical for
  the development of effective and durable treatment strategies against liquid tumors.
  In this review, we focus on the specific involvement of the Hedgehog (HH)/GLI pathway
  in the manifestation and initiation of various cancer features in hematological
  malignancies, including multiple myeloma, T- and B-cell lymphomas, and lymphoid
