description: The first simultaneous test of muon-electron universality using B^{+}→K^{+}ℓ^{+}ℓ^{-}
  and B^{0}→K^{*0}ℓ^{+}ℓ^{-} decays is performed, in two ranges of the dilepton invariant-mass
  squared, q^{2}. The analysis uses beauty mesons produced in proton-proton collisions
  collected with the LHCb detector between 2011 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated
  luminosity of 9 fb^{-1}. Each of the four lepton universality measurements reported
  is either the first in the given q^{2} interval or ...
