description: In aqueduct stenosis, pressure difference below and above level of obstruction
  leads to bulging of third ventricular floor (TVF) and lamina terminalis (LT). Endoscopic
  third ventriculocisternostomy (ETV) is the standard treatment in these patients.
  We tried to assess success of ETV depending on those two radiological changes in

  the state of TVF as well as LT in same manner in midsagittal MR image. Every ...
