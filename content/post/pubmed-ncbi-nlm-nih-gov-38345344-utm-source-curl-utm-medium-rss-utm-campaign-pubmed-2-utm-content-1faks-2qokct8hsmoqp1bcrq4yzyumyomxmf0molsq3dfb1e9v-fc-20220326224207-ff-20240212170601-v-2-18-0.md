description: The 2'-O-methylation (2'-O-Me) of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) shows plasticity
  that is potentially associated with cell phenotypes. We used RiboMeth-seq profiling
  to reveal growth arrest-specific 2'-O-Me patterns in primary human dermal fibroblasts
  from three different donors. We exposed cells to hydrogen peroxide to induce cellular
  senescence and to high cell densities to promote quiescence by contact inhibition.
  We compared both modes of cell cycle arrest to proliferating cells and could ...
