description: The mechanisms by which viruses hijack the genetic machinery of the cells
  they infect are of current interest. When bacteriophage T4 infects Escherichia coli,
  it uses three different adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) to
  reprogram the transcriptional and translational apparatus of the host by ADP-ribosylation
  using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as a substrate^(1,2). NAD has previously
  been identified as a 5' modification of cellular RNAs^(3-5). Here we report ...
