description: Functions and cell biology of the sphingolipids sphingosine and sphinganine
  in cells are not well understood. While some signaling roles for sphingosine have
  been elucidated, the closely related sphinganine has been described only insofar
  as it does not elicit many of the same signaling responses. Here, we prepared multifunctionalized
  derivatives of the two lipid species that differ only in a single double bond of
  the carbon backbone. Using these novel probes, we were able to define ...
