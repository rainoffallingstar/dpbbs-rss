description: One of the most important properties of membranes is their permeability
  to water and other small molecules. A targeted change in permeability allows the
  passage of molecules to be controlled. Vesicles made of membranes with low water
  permeability are preferable for drug delivery, for example, because they are more
  stable and maintain the drug concentration inside. This study reports on the very
  low water permeability of pure protein membranes composed of a bilayer of the amphiphilic
