description: Newborn screening (NBS) for cystic fibrosis (CF) based on pancreatitis-associated
  protein (PAP) has been performed for several years. While some influencing factors
  are known, there is currently a lack of information on the influence of seasonal
  temperature on PAP determination or on the course of PAP blood concentration in
  infants during the first year of life. Using data from two PAP studies at the Heidelberg
