description: Epigenetic research has brought several important technological achievements,
  including identifying epigenetic clocks and signatures, and developing epigenetic
  editing. The potential military applications of such technologies we discuss are
  stratifying soldiers' health, exposure to trauma using epigenetic testing, information
