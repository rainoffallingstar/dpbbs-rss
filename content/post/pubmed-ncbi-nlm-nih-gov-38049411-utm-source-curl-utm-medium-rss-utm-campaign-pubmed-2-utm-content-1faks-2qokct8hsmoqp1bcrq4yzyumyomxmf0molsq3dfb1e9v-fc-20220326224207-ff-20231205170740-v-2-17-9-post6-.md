description: Despite the importance of Nitric Oxide (NO) as signaling molecule in
  both plant and animal development, the regulatory mechanisms downstream of NO remain
  largely unclear. Here, we show that NO is involved in Arabidopsis shoot stem cell
  control via modifying expression and activity of ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), a core component
  of the RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RdDM) pathway. Mutations in components of the
  RdDM pathway cause meristematic defects, and reduce responses of the stem cell system
  to ...
