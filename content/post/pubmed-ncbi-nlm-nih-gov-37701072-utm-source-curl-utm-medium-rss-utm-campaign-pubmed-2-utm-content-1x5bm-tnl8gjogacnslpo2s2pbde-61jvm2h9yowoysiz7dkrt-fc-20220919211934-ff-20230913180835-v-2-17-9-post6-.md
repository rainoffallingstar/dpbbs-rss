description: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithms has gained
  a lot of interest in the pharmaceutical development field. Our study demonstrates
  utilization of traditional machine learning techniques such as random forest (RF),
  support-vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), deep neural network
  (DNN) as well as advanced deep learning techniques like gated recurrent unit-based
  DNN (GRU-DNN) and graph neural network (GNN), towards predicting human ether-รก-go-go
