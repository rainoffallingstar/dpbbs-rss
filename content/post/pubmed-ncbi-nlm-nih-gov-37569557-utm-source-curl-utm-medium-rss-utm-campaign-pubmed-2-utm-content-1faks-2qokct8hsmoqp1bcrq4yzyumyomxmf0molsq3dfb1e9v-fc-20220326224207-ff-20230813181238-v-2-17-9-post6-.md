description: In this study, we present a complete set of electron scattering cross-sections
  from 1-Methyl-5-Nitroimidazole (1M5NI) molecules for impact energies ranging from
  0.1 to 1000 eV. This information is relevant to evaluate the potential role of 1M5NI
  as a molecular radiosensitizers. The total electron scattering cross-sections (TCS)
  that we previously measured with a magnetically confined electron transmission apparatus
  were considered as the reference values for the present analysis. ...
