description: In contrast to B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), molecular
  subgroups are less well defined in T-lineage ALL. Comprehensive studies on molecular
  T-ALL subgroups have been predominantly performed in pediatric ALL patients. Currently,
  molecular characteristics are rarely considered for risk stratification. Herein,
  we present a homogenously treated cohort of 230 adult T-ALL patients characterized
  on transcriptome, and partly on DNA methylation and gene mutation level ...
