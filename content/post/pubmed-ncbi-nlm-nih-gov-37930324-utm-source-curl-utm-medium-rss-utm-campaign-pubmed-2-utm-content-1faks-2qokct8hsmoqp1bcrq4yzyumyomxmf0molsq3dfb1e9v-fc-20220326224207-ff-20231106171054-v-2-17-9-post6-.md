description: Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal
  phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of
  axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal
  injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated
  with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study
  was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the
