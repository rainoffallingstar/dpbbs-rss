description: Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) are known to orchestrate multiple
  components of the tumor microenvironment, whereas the influence of the whole stromal-fibroblast
  compartment is less understood. Here, an extended stromal fibroblast signature was
  investigated to define its impact on immune cell infiltration. The lung cancer adenocarcinoma
  (LUAD) data set of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) was used to test whole stroma
  signatures and cancer-associated fibroblast signatures for their impact ...
