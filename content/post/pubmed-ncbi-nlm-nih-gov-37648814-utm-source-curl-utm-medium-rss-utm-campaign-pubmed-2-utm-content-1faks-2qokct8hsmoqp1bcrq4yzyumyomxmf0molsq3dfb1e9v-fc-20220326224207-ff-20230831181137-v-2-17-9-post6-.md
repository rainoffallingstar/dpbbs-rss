description: Recent exome-wide studies discovered frequent somatic mutations in the
  epigenetic modifier ZNF217 in primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and related
  disorders. As functional consequences of ZNF217 alterations remain unknown, we comprehensively
  evaluated their impact in PMBCL. Targeted sequencing identified genetic lesions
  affecting ZNF217 in 33% of 157 PMBCL patients. Subsequent gene expression profiling
  (n = 120) revealed changes in cytokine and interferon signal transduction ...
