description: The unicellular parasite Giardia duodenalis is the causative agent of
  giardiasis, a gastrointestinal disease with global spread. In its trophozoite form,
  G. duodenalis can adhere to the human intestinal epithelium and a variety of other,
  artificial surfaces. Its attachment is facilitated by a unique microtubule-based
  attachment organelle, the so-called ventral disc. The mechanical function of the
  ventral disc, however, is still debated. Earlier studies postulated that a dynamic
