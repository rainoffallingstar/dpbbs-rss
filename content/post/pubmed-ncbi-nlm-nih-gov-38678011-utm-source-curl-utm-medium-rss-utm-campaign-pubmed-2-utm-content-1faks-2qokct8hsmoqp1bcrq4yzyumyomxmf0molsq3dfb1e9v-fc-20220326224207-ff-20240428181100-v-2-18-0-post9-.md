description: Recurrent DNA break clusters (RDCs) are replication-transcription collision
  hotspots; many are unique to neural progenitor cells. Through high-resolution replication
  sequencing and a capture-ligation assay in mouse neural progenitor cells experiencing
  replication stress, we unravel the replication features dictating RDC location and

  regions (TTRs), where sparse replication origins connect unidirectional ...
