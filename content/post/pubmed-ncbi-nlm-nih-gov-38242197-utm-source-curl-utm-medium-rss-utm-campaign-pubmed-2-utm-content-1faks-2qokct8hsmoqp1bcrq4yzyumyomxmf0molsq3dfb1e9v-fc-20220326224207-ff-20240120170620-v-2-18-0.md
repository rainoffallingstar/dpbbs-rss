description: The transcriptional co-activators of the Hippo pathway, YAP and TAZ,
  are regulated by mechanotransduction, which depends on dynamic actin cytoskeleton
  remodeling. Here, we identified SEPTIN10 as a novel cytoskeletal protein, which
  is transcriptionally regulated by YAP/TAZ and whose overexpression correlates with
  poor survival and vascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.
