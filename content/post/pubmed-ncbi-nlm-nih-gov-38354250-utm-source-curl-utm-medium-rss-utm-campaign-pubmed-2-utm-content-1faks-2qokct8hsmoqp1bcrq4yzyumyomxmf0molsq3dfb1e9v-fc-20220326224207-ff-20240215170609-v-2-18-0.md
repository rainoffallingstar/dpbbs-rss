description: The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a zipper-like protein assembly that
  links homologous chromosomes to regulate recombination and segregation during meiosis.
  The SC has been notoriously refractory to in vitro reconstitution, thus leaving
  its molecular organization largely unknown. Here, we report a moonlighting function
  of two paralogous S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (Skp1)-related proteins (SKR-1
  and SKR-2), well-known adaptors of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase, as
