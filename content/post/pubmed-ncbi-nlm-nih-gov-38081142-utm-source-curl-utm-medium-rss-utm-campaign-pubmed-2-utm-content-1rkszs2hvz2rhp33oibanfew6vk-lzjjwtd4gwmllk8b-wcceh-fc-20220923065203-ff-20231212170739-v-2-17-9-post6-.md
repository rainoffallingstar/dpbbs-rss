description: Patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) that is
  refractory to a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), and an anti-CD38
  antibody (triple-class refractory MM) have poor outcomes. Recently, 2 classes of
  T-cell engaging therapies-CAR T-cell therapy and bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies
  (BsAbs)-have resulted in unprecedented response rates and survival outcomes in these
  heavily pretreated patients. The most common targets are BCMA and GPRC5D, with ...
