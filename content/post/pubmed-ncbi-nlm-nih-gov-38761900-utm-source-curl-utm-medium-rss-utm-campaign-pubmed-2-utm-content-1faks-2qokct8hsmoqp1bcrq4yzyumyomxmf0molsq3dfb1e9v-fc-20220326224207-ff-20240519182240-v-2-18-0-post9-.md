description: The current outbreak of mpox presents a significant threat to the global
  community. However, the lack of mpox-specific drugs necessitates the identification
  of additional candidates for clinical trials. In this study, a network medicine
  framework was used to investigate poxviruses-human interactions to identify potential
  drugs effective against the mpox virus (MPXV). The results indicated that poxviruses
  preferentially target hubs on the human interactome, and that these ...
