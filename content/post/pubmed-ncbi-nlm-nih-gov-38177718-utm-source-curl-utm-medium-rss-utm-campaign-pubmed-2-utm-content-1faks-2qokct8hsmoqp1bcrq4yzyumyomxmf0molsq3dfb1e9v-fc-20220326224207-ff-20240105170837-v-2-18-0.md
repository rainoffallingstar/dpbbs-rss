description: Visual field deficits (VFDs) are common in patients with temporal and
  occipital lobe lesions. Diffusion tensor fiber tractography (DTI-FT) is widely used
  for surgery planning to reduce VFDs. Q-ball high-resolution fiber tractography (QBI-HRFT)
  improves upon DTI. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of DTI-FT and QBI-HRFT
  for surgery planning near the optic radiation (OR) as well as the correlation between
  VFDs, the nearest distance from the lesion to the OR fiber bundle (nD-LOR), ...
