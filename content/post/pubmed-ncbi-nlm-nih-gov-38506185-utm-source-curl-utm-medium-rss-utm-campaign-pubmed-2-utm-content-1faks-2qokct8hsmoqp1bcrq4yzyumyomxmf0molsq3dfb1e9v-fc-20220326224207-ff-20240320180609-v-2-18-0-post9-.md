description: Muscle synergies as functional low-dimensional building blocks of the
  neuromotor system regulate the activation patterns of muscle groups in a modular
  structure during locomotion. The purpose of the current study was to explore how
  older adults organize locomotor muscle synergies to counteract unpredictable and
  predictable gait perturbations during the perturbed and the recovery steps. Sixty-three
  healthy older adults (71.2 ± 5.2 years) participated in the study. Mediolateral
