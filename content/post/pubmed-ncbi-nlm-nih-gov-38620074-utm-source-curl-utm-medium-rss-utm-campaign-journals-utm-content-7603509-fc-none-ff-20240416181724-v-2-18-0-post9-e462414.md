description: SRY-related HMG-box gene 11 (SOX11) is a transcription factor overexpressed
  in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a subset of Burkitt lymphomas (BL) and precursor
  lymphoid cell neoplasms but is absent in normal B-cells and other B-cell lymphomas.
  SOX11 has an oncogenic role in MCL but its contribution to BL pathogenesis remains
  uncertain. Here, we observed that the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and SOX11
  expression were mutually exclusive in BL. SOX11 expression in EBV- BL was associated
  with ...
