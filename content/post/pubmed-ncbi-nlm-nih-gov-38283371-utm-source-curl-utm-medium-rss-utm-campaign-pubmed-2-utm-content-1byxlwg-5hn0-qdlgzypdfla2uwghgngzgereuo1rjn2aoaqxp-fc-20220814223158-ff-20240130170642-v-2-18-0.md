description: Artificial Intelligence has observed significant growth in its ability
  to classify different types of tumors in humans due to advancements in digital pathology
  technology. Among these tumors, lymphomas are quite common in dogs, despite studies
  on the application of AI in domestic species are scarce. This research aims to employ
  deep learning (DL) through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between
  normal lymph nodes and 3 WHO common subtypes of canine lymphomas. To train ...
