description: 'CONCLUSIONS: This first study evaluating the diagnostic potential of
  NIR spectroscopy in urothelial cancer shows that it can be accurately used to assess
  tissue in an ex vivo setting immediately after TURBT. This offers point-of-care
  assessment of bladder pathology, with potential to influence the extent of resection,
