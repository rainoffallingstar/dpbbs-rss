description: Cholinergic nerves are involved in tumor progression and dissemination.
  In contrast to other visceral tissues, cholinergic innervation in the hepatic parenchyma
  is poorly detected. It remains unclear whether there is any form of cholinergic
  regulation of liver cancer. Here, we show that cholinergic T cells curtail the development
  of liver cancer by supporting antitumor immune responses. In a mouse multihit model
