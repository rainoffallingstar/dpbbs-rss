description: Effective, unbiased, high-throughput methods to functionally identify
  both class II and class I HLA-presented T cell epitopes and their cognate T cell
  receptors (TCRs) are essential for and prerequisite to diagnostic and therapeutic
  applications, yet remain underdeveloped. Here, we present T-FINDER [T cell Functional
  Identification and (Neo)-antigen Discovery of Epitopes and Receptors], a system
  to rapidly deconvolute CD4 and CD8 TCRs and targets physiologically processed and
