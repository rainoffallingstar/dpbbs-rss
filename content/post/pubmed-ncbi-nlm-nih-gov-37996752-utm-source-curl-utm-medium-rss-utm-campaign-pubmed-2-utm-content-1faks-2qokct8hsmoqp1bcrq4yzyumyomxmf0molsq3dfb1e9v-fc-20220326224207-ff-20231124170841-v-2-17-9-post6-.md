description: Cardinal v.3 is an open-source software for reproducible analysis of
  mass spectrometry imaging experiments. A major update from its previous versions,
  Cardinal v.3 supports most mass spectrometry imaging workflows. Its analytical capabilities
  include advanced data processing such as mass recalibration, advanced statistical
  analyses such as single-ion segmentation and rough annotation-based classification,
  and memory-efficient analyses of large-scale multitissue ...
