description: Behaviour change interventions for weight management have found varied
  effect sizes and frequent weight re-gain after weight loss. There is interest in
  exploring whether differences in eating behaviour can be used to develop tailored
  weight management programs. This secondary analysis of an 18-month weight maintenance
  randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to investigate the association between individual
  variability in weight maintenance success and change in eating behaviour traits
