description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq is one of the most commonly
  performed bioinformatics analyses. Transcript-level quantifications are inherently
  more uncertain than gene-level read counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence
  reads to transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned unambiguously
  to a gene, reads are very often compatible with multiple transcripts for that gene,
  particularly for genes with many isoforms. Software tools designed for ...
