description: The advancement of single-cell sequencing technology has smoothed the
  ability to do biological studies at the cellular level. Nevertheless, single-cell
  RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data presents several obstacles due to the considerable
  heterogeneity, sparsity and complexity. Although many machine-learning models have
  been devised to tackle these difficulties, there is still a need to enhance their
  efficiency and accuracy. Current deep learning methods often fail to fully exploit
