description: As the number of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) examinations
  is expected to increase, technologies to optimize the imaging workflow are of great
  interest. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of artificial intelligence
  (AI) to improve clinical workflow and diagnostic accuracy in high-volume cardiac
  imaging centers. A total of 120 patients (79 men; 62.4 (55.0-72.7) years; 26.7 (24.9-30.3)
  kg/m²) undergoing coronary CTA were randomly assigned to a standard or ...
