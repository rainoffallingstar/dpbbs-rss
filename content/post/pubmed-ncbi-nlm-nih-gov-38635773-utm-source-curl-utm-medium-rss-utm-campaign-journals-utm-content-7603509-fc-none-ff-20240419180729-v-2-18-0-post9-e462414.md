description: Pseudouridine is the most prevalent RNA modification, and its aberrant
  function is implicated in various human diseases. However, the specific impact of
  pseudouridylation on hematopoiesis remains poorly understood. In this study, we
  investigated the role of tRNA pseudouridylation in erythropoiesis and its association
  with mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia syndrome
  (MLASA) pathogenesis. By utilizing patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells
  (iPSCs) carrying ...
