description: Cachexia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with
  cancer and is characterized by weight loss due to adipose and muscle tissue wasting.
  Hallmarks of white adipose tissue (WAT) remodeling, which often precedes weight
  loss, are impaired lipid storage, inflammation and eventually fibrosis. Tissue wasting
  occurs in response to tumor-secreted factors. Considering that the continuous endothelium
  in WAT is the first line of contact with circulating factors, we postulated ...
