  de novo root organogenesis during in vitro plantlet regeneration share a common
  auxin-OsWOX10 regulatory module in rice. In the fibrous-type root system of rice,
  the crown roots (CR) are developed naturally from the shoot tissues. Generation

  and signaling pathways at the onset of crown root primordia (CRP) establishment
