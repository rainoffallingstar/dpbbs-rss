description: In everyday perception, we combine incoming sensory information with
  prior expectations. Expectations can be induced by cues that indicate the probability
  of following sensory events. The information provided by cues may differ and hence
  lead to different levels of uncertainty about which event will follow. In this experiment,
  we employed pupillometry to investigate whether the pupil dilation response to visual
  cues varies depending on the level of cue-associated uncertainty about a ...
