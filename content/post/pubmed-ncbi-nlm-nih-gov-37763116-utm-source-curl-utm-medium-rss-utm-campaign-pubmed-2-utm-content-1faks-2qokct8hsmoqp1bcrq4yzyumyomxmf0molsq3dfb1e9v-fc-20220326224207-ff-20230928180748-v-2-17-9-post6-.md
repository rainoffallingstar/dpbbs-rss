description: This study investigates the prognostic value of cardiac troponin I (cTNI)
  and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in patients with
  cardiogenic shock (CS). Data regarding the prognostic value of cardiac biomarkers
  in CS is scarce, furthermore, most studies were restricted to CS patients with acute
  myocardial infarction (AMI). Therefore, consecutive patients with CS from 2019 to
  2021 were included. Blood samples were retrieved from day of disease onset (day
  1) and on ...
