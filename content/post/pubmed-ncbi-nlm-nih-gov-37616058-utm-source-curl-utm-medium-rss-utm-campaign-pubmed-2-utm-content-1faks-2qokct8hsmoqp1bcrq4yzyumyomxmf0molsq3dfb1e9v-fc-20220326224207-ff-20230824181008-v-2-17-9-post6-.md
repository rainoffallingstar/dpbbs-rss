description: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) can lead to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
  and mortality, however, few mechanistic biomarkers are available for high risk patients,
  especially those without macroalbuminuria. Urine from participants with diabetes
  from Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC), Singapore Study of Macro-Angiopathy
  and Reactivity in Type 2 Diabetes (SMART2D), and the Pima Indian Study determined
  if urine adenine/creatinine ratio (UAdCR) could be a mechanistic biomarker for ESKD.
