description: Polo-like kinase (Plk4) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase that is
  essential for biogenesis of the centriole organelle and is enriched at centrioles.
  Herein, we introduce Cen-TCO, a chemical probe based on the Plk4 inhibitor centrinone,
  to image Plk4 and centrioles in live or fixed cultured human cells. Specifically,
  we established a bio-orthogonal two-step labeling system that enables the Cen-TCO-mediated
  imaging of Plk4 by STED super-resolution microscopy. Such direct labeling of ...
