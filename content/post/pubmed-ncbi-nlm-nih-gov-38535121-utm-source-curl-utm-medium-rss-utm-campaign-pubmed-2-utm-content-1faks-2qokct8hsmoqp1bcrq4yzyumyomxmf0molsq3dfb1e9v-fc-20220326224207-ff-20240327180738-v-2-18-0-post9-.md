description: Newborn screening (NBS) for hepatorenal tyrosinemia type I (HT1) based
  on a determination of succinylacetone is performed in countries worldwide. Recently,
  biallelic pathogenic variants in GSTZ1 underlying maleylacetoacetate isomerase (MAAI)
  deficiency have been described as a differential diagnosis in individuals with slightly
  elevated succinylacetone detected by NBS. We report the experience with NBS for
