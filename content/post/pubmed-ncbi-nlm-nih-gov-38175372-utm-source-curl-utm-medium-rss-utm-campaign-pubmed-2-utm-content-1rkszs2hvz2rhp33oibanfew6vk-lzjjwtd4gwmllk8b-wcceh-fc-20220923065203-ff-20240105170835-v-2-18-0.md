description: Detection of ALK rearrangement and/or expression of the ALK protein is
  an essential component in the evaluation of many neoplasms. Variability has been
  reported in the ability of different antibody clones to detect ALK expression. The
  ALK01 clone is commonly used to detect ALK expression in ALK-positive anaplastic
  large cell lymphoma (ALK + ALCL). However, this clone has been shown to lack sensitivity
  when used for solid tumors. The aim of this study was to determine if our ...
