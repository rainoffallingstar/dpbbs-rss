description: The dynamics of DNA in the cell nucleus plays a role in cellular processes
  and fates but the interplay of DNA mobility with the hierarchical levels of DNA
  organization is still underexplored. Here, we made use of DNA replication to directly
  label genomic DNA in an unbiased genome-wide manner. This was followed by live-cell
  time-lapse microscopy of the labeled DNA combining imaging at different resolutions
  levels simultaneously and allowing one to trace DNA motion across organization ...
