  complex experimental conditions, there is an opportunity to leverage single-cell
  variability to reveal deeper insights into how cells respond to perturbations. Many
  existing approaches rely on discretizing the data into clusters for differential
  gene expression (DGE), effectively ironing out any information unveiled by the single-cell
  variability across cell-types. In addition, DGE often assumes a statistical distribution
