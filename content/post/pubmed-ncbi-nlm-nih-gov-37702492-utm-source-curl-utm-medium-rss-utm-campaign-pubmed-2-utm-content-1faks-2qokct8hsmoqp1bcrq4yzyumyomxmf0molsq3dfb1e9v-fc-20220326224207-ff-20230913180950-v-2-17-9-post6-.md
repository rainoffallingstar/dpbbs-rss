description: Dengue virus (DENV) is a major human pathogen. An important pathogenicity
  factor is non-structural protein 1 (NS1) required for viral replication and secreted
  from infected cells. A clinical study indicated that the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin
  lowers NS1 blood levels without affecting viremia. Ivermectin targets nuclear transport
  by binding to importin-α, but how NS1 secretion in patients is suppressed by this
  drug is unknown. We show that ivermectin impairs folding and secretion ...
