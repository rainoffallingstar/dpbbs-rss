description: Organ-on-chip technology is a powerful tool for in vitro modeling. Combining
  it with organoids overcomes lumen inaccessibility while preserving cellular diversity
  and function of the intestinal epithelium. Here, we present a protocol for generating
  and analyzing organ-on-chips using human and mouse intestinal organoids. This protocol
  covers organoid line establishment, single-cell dissociation, chip preparation,
  and seeding. It outlines procedures for permeability assays, RNA ...
