description: Tractography algorithms are prone to reconstructing spurious connections.
  The set of streamlines generated with tractography can be post-processed to retain
  the streamlines that are most biologically plausible. Several microstructure-informed
  filtering algorithms are available for this purpose, however, the comparative performance
  of these methods has not been extensively evaluated. In this study, we aim to evaluate
  streamline filtering and post-processing algorithms using simulated ...
