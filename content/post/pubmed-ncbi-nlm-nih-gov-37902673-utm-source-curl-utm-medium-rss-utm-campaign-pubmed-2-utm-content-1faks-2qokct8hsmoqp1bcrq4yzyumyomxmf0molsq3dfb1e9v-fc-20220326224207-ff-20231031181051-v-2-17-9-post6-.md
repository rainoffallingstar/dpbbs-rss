description: Views of aging predict key developmental outcomes. Less is known, however,
  about the consequences of constellations of domain-specific perceived gains and
  losses across the full adult lifespan. First, we explored levels of awareness of
  age-related gains (AARC-gains) and losses (AARC-losses) in five behavioral domains
  across adulthood. Second, we identified the number and types of profiles of AARC-gains
  and AARC-losses in young adulthood, midlife, young-old age, and old-old age. Third,
