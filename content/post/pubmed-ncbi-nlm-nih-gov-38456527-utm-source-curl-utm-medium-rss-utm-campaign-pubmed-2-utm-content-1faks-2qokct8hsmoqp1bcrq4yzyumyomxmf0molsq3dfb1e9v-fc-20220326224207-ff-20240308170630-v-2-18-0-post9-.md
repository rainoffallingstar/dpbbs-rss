description: Time-Resolved Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (TR-SFX) conducted at
  X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) has become a powerful tool for capturing macromolecular
  structural movies of light-initiated processes. As the capabilities of XFELs advance,
  we anticipate that a new range of coherent control and structural Raman measurements
  will become achievable. Shorter optical and x-ray pulse durations and increasingly
  more exotic pulse regimes are becoming available at free electron lasers. ...
