description: Synovial inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the
  release of cartilage-degrading enzymes and inflammatory cytokines. 45S5-bioactive
  glass (45S5-BG) can modulate inflammation processes; however, its influence on OA-associated
  inflammation has hardly been investigated. In this study, the effects of 45S5-BG
  on the release of cartilage-degrading metalloproteinases and cytokines from synovial
  membrane cells (SM) isolated from patients with knee OA was assessed in vitro. SM
