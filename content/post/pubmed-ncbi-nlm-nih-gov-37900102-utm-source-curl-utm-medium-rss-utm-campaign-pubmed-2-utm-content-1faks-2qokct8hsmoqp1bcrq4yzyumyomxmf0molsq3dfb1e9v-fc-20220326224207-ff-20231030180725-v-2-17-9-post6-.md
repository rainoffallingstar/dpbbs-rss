description: The interaction of RNA with specific RNA-binding proteins (RBP) leads
  to the establishment of complex regulatory networks through which gene expression
  is controlled. Careful consideration should be given to the exact environment where
  a given RNA/RBP interplay occurs, as the functional responses might depend on the
  type of organism as well as the specific cellular or subcellular contexts. This
  requisite becomes particularly crucial for the study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA),
