description: Reverse transcriptases (RT) are essential tools in BCR::ABL1 fusion transcript
  monitoring in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The RT type and cDNA priming method
  may impair the stoichiometry of cDNA synthesis, thereby potentially introducing
  a bias in BCR::ABL1 qRT-PCR data. Using the Acrometrix™ BCR::ABL1 reference panel
  and 37 clinical specimens, we have comparatively investigated the performance of
  the RTs MLV and SuperScript IV with random hexamer vs. target-specific priming.
