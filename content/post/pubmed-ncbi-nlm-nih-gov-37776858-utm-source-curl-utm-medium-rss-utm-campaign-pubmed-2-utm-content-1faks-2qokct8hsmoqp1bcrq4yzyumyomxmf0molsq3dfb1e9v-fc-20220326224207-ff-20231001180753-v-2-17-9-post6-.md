description: The dynamics of immunity to infection in infants remain obscure. Here,
  we used a multi-omics approach to perform a longitudinal analysis of immunity to
  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in infants and young
  children by analyzing blood samples and weekly nasal swabs collected before, during,
  and after infection with Omicron and non-Omicron variants. Infection stimulated
  robust antibody titers that, unlike in adults, showed no sign of decay for up to
  300 days. ...
