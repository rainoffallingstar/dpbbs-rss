description: A novel methylation class, "neuroepithelial tumor, with PLAGL1 fusion"
  (NET-PLAGL1), has recently been described, based on epigenetic features, as a supratentorial
  pediatric brain tumor with recurrent histopathological features suggesting an ependymal
  differentiation. Because of the recent identification of this neoplastic entity,
  few histopathological, radiological and clinical data are available. Herein, we
