description: In-frame BRAF exon 12 deletions are increasingly identified in various
  tumor types. The resultant BRAF^(Δβ3-αC) oncoproteins usually lack five amino acids
  in the β3-αC helix linker and sometimes contain de novo insertions. The dimerization
  status of BRAF^(Δβ3-αC) oncoproteins, their precise pathomechanism, and their direct
  druggability by RAF inhibitors (RAFi) has been under debate. Here, we functionally
  characterize BRAF^(ΔLNVTAP>F) and two novel mutants, BRAF^(delinsFS) and BRAF^(ΔLNVT>F),
