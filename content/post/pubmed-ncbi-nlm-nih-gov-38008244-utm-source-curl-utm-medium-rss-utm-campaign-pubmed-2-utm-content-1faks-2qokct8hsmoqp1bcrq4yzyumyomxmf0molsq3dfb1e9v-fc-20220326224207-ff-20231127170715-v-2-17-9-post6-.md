description: Deletions on the long arm of chromosome 9 (del(9q)) are recurrent abnormalities
  in about 2 % of acute myeloid leukemia cases, which usually involve HNRNPK and are
  frequently associated with other known aberrations. Based on an Hnrnpk haploinsufficient
  mouse model, a recent study demonstrated a function of hnRNP K in pathogenesis of
  myeloid malignancies via the regulation of cellular proliferation and myeloid differentiation
  programs. Here, we provide evidence that reduced hnRNP K ...
