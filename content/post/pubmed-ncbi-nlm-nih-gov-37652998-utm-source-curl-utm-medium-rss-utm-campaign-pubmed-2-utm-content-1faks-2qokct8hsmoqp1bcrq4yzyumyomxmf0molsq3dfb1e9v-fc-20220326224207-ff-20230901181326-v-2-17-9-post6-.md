description: Human activities are causing global biotic redistribution, translocating
  species and providing them with opportunities to establish populations beyond their
  native ranges. Species originating from certain global regions, however, are disproportionately
  represented among naturalized aliens. The evolutionary imbalance hypothesis posits
  that differences in absolute fitness among biogeographic divisions determine outcomes
  when biotas mix. Here, we compile data from native and alien distributions ...
