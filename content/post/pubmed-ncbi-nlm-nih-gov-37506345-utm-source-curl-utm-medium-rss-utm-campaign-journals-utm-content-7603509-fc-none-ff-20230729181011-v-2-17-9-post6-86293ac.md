description: Human 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) is a key enzyme involved in platelet activation
  and regulation of its activity has been targeted for treatment of heparin-induced
  thrombocytopenia. Despite the clinical importance of 12-LOX, the exact mechanisms
  of how it affects platelet activation are not fully understood, and the lack of
  structural information has limited drug discovery efforts. In this study, we used
  single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to determine the high-resolution structures
  (1.7 Å ...
