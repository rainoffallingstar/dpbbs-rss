description: STXBP1-related disorders are among the most common genetic epilepsies
  and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the longitudinal epilepsy course and
  developmental end points, have not yet been described in detail, which is a critical
  prerequisite for clinical trial readiness. Here, we assessed 1281 cumulative patient-years
  of seizure and developmental histories in 162 individuals with STXBP1-related disorders
  and established a natural history framework. STXBP1-related disorders ...
