description: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed a global deficiency of systematic, data-driven
  guidance to identify high-risk individuals. Here, we illustrate the utility of routinely
  recorded medical history to predict the risk for 1883 diseases across clinical specialties
  and support the rapid response to emerging health threats such as COVID-19. We developed
