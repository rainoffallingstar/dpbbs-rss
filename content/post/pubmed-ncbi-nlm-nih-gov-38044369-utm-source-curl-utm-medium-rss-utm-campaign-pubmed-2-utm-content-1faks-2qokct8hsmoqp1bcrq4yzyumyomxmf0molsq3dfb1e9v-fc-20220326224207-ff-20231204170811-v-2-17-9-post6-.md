description: Accurate forecasting of hospital bed demand is crucial during infectious
  disease epidemics to avoid overwhelming healthcare facilities. To address this,
  we developed an intuitive online tool for individual hospitals to forecast COVID-19
  bed demand. The tool utilizes local data, including incidence, vaccination, and
  bed occupancy data, at customizable geographical resolutions. Users can specify
  their hospital's catchment area and adjust the initial number of COVID-19 occupied
  beds. We ...
