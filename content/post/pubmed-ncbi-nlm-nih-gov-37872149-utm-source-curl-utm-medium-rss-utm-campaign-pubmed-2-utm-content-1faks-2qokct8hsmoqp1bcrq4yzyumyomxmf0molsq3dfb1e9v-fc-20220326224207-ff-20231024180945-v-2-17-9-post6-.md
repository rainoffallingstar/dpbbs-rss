description: Tandem repeats (TRs) represent one of the largest sources of genetic
  variation in humans and are implicated in a range of phenotypes. Here we present
  a deep characterization of TR variation based on high coverage whole genome sequencing
  from 3550 diverse individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project and H3Africa cohorts.
  We develop a method, EnsembleTR, to integrate genotypes from four separate methods
  resulting in high-quality genotypes at more than 1.7 million TR loci. Our catalog
  reveals ...
