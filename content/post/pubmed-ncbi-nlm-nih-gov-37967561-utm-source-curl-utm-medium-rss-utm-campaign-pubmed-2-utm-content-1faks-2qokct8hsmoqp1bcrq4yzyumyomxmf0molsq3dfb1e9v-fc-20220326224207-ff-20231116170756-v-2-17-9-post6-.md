description: Physical forces are ubiquitous in biological processes across scales
  and diverse contexts. This review highlights the significance of mechanical forces
  in nervous system development, homeostasis, and disease. We provide an overview
  of mechanical signals present in the nervous system and delve into mechanotransduction
  mechanisms translating these mechanical cues into biochemical signals. During development,
  mechanical cues regulate a plethora of processes, including cell ...
