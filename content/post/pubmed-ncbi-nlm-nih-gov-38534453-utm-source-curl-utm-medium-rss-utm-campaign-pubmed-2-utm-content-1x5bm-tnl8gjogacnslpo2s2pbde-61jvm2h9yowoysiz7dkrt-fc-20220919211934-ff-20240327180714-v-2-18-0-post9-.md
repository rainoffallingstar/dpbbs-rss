description: Cancer is a complex and evolutionary disease mainly driven by the accumulation
  of genetic variations in genes. Identifying cancer driver genes is important. However,
  most related studies have focused on the population level. Cancer is a disease with
  high heterogeneity. Thus, the discovery of driver genes at the individual level
  is becoming more valuable but is a great challenge. Although there have been some
  computational methods proposed to tackle this challenge, few can cover all ...
