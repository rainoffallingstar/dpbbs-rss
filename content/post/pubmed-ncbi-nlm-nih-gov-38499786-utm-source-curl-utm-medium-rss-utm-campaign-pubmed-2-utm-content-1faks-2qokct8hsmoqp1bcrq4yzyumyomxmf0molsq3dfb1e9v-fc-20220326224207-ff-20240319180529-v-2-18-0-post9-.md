description: Regulatory T (TREG) cells develop via a program orchestrated by the transcription
  factor forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3). Maintenance of the TREG cell lineage relies
  on sustained FOXP3 transcription via a mechanism involving demethylation of cytosine-phosphate-guanine
  (CpG)-rich elements at conserved non-coding sequences (CNS) in the FOXP3 locus.
  This cytosine demethylation is catalyzed by the ten-eleven translocation (TET) family
  of dioxygenases, and it involves a redox reaction that uses ...
