description: SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies provide protection against COVID-19.
  Evidence from early vaccine trials suggested binding antibody thresholds could serve
  as surrogate markers of neutralising capacity, but whether these thresholds predict
  sufficient neutralising capacity against variants of concern (VOCs), and whether
  this is impacted by vaccine or infection history remains unclear. Here we analyse
  individuals recovered from, vaccinated or with hybrid immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
