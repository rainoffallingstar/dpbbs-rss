description: CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells achieve high response
  rates in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. However, their
  use is associated with significant toxicity, relapse is a concern, and their broad
  tractability is unclear. Pre-clinical and clinical data support a beneficial synergistic
  effect of ibrutinib on apheresis product fitness, CAR-T expansion and toxicity.
  We evaluated the combination of time-limited ibrutinib and CTL019 CAR-T in 20 patients
