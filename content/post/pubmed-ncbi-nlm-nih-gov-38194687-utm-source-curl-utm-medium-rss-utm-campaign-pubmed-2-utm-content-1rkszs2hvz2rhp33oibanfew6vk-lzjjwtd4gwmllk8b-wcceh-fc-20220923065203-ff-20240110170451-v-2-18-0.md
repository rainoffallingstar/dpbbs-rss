description: Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) progresses to chronic lymphocytic
  leukemia (CLL) requiring therapy at 1-5%/year. Improved prediction of progression
  would greatly benefit individuals with MBL. CLL patients separate into three distinct
  epigenetic subtypes (epitypes) with high prognostic significance, and recently the
  intermediate epitype has been shown to be enriched for high-risk IGLV3-21 rearrangements,
  impacting outcomes for these patients. Here we employed this combined strategy ...
