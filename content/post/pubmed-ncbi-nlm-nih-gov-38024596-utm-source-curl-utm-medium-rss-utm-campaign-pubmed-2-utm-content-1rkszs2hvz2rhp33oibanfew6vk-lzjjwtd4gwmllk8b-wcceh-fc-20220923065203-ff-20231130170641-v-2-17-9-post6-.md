description: Lymphoid cancers are among the most frequent cancers diagnosed in adolescents
  and young adults (AYA), ranging from approximately 30%-35% of cancer diagnoses in
  adolescent patients (age 10-19) to approximately 10% in patients aged 30-39 years.
  Moreover, the specific distribution of lymphoid cancer types varies by age with
  substantial shifts in the subtype distributions between pediatric, AYA, adult, and
  older adult patients. Currently, biology studies specific to AYA lymphomas are rare
