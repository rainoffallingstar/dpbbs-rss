description: The excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance is an important molecular pathological
  feature of major depressive disorder (MDD) as altered GABA and glutamate levels
  have been found in multiple brain regions in patients. Healthy subjects show topographic
  organization of the E/I balance (EIB) across various brain regions. We here raise
  the question of whether such EIB topography is altered in MDD. Therefore, we systematically
  review the gene and protein expressions of inhibitory GABAergic ...
