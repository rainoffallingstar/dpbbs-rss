description: Personalised oncology, whereby patients are given therapies based on
  their molecular tumour profile, is rapidly becoming an essential part of optimal
  clinical care, at least partly facilitated by recent advances in next-generation
  sequencing-based technology using liquid- and tissue-based biopsies. Consequently,
