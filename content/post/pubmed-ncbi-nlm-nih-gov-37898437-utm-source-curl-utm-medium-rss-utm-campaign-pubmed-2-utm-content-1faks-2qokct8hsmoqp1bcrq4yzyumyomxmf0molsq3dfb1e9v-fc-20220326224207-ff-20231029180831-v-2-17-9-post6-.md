description: MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is a highly complex treatment modality,
  allowing adaptation to anatomical changes occurring from one treatment day to the
  other (inter-fractional), but also to motion occurring during a treatment fraction
  (intra-fractional). In this vision paper, we describe the different steps of intra-fractional
  motion management during MRIgRT, from imaging to beam adaptation, and the solutions
  currently available both clinically and at a research level. ...
