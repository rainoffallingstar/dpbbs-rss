  multiple potential pathways. Differential DNA methylation may provide a mechanistic
  understanding of these long-term associations. We aimed to quantify the associations
  of MEA with offspring DNA methylation levels at birth, in childhood and in adolescence.
  Using 37 studies from high-income countries, we performed meta-analysis of epigenome-wide
