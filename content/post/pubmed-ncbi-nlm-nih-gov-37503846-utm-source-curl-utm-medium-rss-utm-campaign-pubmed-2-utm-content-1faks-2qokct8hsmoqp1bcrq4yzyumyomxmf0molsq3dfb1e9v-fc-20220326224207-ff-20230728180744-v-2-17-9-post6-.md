description: We investigate the electron emission from 3D chiral silver alloy nanohelices
  initiated by femtosecond laser pulses with a central photon energy of hν = 1.65
  eV, well below the work function of the material. We find hot but thermally distributed
  electron spectra and a strong anisotropy in the electron yield with left- and right-circularly
  polarized light excitations, which invert in sign between left- and right-handed
  helices. We analyze the kinetic energy distribution and discuss the role ...
