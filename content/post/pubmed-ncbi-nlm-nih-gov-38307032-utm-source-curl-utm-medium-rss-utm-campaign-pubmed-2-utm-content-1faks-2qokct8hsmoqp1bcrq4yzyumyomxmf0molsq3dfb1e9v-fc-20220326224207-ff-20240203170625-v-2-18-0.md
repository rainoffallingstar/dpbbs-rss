description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy involving multiple cellular
  components. The CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) has been characterized well at
  single-cell resolution. However, a spatial interaction map of the CRC TME is still
  elusive. Here, we integrate multiomics analyses and establish a spatial interaction
  map to improve the prognosis, prediction, and therapeutic development for CRC. We
  construct a CRC immune module (CCIM) that comprises FOLR2^(+) macrophages, exhausted
