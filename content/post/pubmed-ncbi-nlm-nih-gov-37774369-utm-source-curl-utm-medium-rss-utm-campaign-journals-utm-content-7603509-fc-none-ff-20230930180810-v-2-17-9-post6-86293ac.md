description: Vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOE) cause severe pain in sickle cell disease
  (SCD) patients. Vaso-occlusive events promote ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) pathobiology
  that activates complement. We hypothesized that complement activation is linked
  to VOE. We used cold to induce VOE in the Townes sickle (HbSS) mouse model and complement
  inhibitors to determine whether anaphylatoxin C5a mediates VOE. We used a dorsal
  skinfold chamber to measure microvascular stasis (vaso-occlusion) and von ...
