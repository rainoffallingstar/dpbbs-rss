description: The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of
  proteins. Inhibition of the anti-apoptotic members represents a strategy to induce
  apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. We have measured the membrane binding properties
  of a series of peptides, including modified α/β-peptides, designed to exhibit enhanced
  membrane permeability to allow cell entry and improved access for engagement of
  Bcl-2 family members. The peptide cargo is based on the pro-apoptotic protein Bim,
