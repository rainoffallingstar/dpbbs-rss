description: Evidence from mice with global deletion of fatty-acid transport protein4
  (FATP4) indicates its role on β-oxidation and triglycerides (TG) metabolism. We
  reported that plasma glycerol and free fatty acids (FA) were increased in liver-specific
  Fatp4 deficient (L-FATP4^(-/-)) mice under dietary stress. We hypothesized that
  FATP4 may mediate hepatocellular TG lipolysis. Here, we demonstrated that L-FATP4^(-/-)
  mice showed an increase in these blood lipids, liver TG, and subcutaneous fat weights.
