description: Diseases induced by infection with pathogenic orthohantaviruses are characterized
  by a pronounced organ-specific manifestation. Pathogenic Eurasian orthohantaviruses
  cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) with often massive proteinuria.
  Therefore, the use of a relevant kidney cell culture would be favorable to analyze
  the underlying cellular mechanisms of orthohantavirus-induced acute kidney injury
  (AKI). We tested different human tubular epithelial cell lines for their ...
