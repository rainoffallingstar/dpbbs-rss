description: The solvent and catalyst free thermolysis of biphenylenes at 350 째C furnishes
  [n]cyclo-ortho-phenylenes ([n]COPs, n = 4-10) in one step and in high yields. At
  400 째C biphenylene dimerizes into tetraphenylene, but lower reaction temperatures
  produce cyclooligomers. If suitably substituted, the oligomers are soluble and can
  be isolated and characterized. The products are exclusively cyclic. In the crystalline
  state, [6]COP displays an alternating crown-shaped ...
