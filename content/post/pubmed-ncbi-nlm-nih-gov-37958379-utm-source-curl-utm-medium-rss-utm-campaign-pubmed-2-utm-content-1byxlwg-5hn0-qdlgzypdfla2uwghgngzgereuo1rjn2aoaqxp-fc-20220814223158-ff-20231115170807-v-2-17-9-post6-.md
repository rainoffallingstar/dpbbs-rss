description: Deep learning applications are emerging as promising new tools that can
  support the diagnosis and classification of different cancer types. While such solutions
  hold great potential for hematological malignancies, there have been limited studies
  describing the use of such applications in this field. The rapid diagnosis of double/triple-hit
  lymphomas (DHLs/THLs) involving MYC, BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements is obligatory
  for optimal patient care. Here, we present a novel deep learning tool ...
