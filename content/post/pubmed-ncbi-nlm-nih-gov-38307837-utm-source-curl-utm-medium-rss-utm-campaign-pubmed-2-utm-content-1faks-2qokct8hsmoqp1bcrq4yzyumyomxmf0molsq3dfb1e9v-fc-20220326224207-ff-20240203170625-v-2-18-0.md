description: Establishment of the left-right (LR, sinistral, dextral) body axis in
  many vertebrate embryos relies on cilia-driven leftward fluid flow within an LR
  organizer (LRO). A cardinal question is how leftward flow triggers symmetry breakage.
  The chemosensation model posits that ciliary flow enriches a signaling molecule
  on the left side of the LRO that promotes sinistral cell fate. However, the nature
  of this sinistralizing signal has remained elusive. In the Xenopus LRO, we identified
