description: An early event in the genesis of follicular lymphoma (FL) is the acquisition
  of new glycosylation motifs in the B cell receptor (BCR) due to gene rearrangement
  and/or somatic hypermutation. These N-linked glycosylation motifs (N-motifs) contain
  mannose-terminated glycans and can interact with lectins in the tumor microenvironment,
  activating the tumor BCR pathway. N-motifs are stable during FL evolution suggesting
  that FL tumor cells are dependent on them for their survival. Here, ...
