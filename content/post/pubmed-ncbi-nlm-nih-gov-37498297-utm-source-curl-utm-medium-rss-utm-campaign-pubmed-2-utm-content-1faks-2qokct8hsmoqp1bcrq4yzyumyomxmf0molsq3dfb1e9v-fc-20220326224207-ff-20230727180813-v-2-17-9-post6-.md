description: Algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC) schemes represent a family
  of ab initio methods for the calculation of excited electronic states and electron-detached
  and -attached states. All ADC methods have been demonstrated to possess great potential
  for molecular applications, e.g., for the calculation of absorption or photoelectron
  spectra or electron attachment processes. ADC originates from Green's function or
  propagator theory; however, most recent ADC developments heavily rely on ...
