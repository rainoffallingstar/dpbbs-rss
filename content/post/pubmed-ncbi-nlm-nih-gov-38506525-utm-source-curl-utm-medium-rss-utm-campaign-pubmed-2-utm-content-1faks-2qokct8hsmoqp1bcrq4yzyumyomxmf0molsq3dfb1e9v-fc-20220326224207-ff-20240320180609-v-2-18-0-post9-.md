description: Manual microscopy of Gram stains from positive blood cultures (PBCs)
  is crucial for diagnosing bloodstream infections but remains labor intensive, time
  consuming, and subjective. This study aimed to evaluate a scan and analysis system
  that combines fully automated digital microscopy with deep convolutional neural
  networks (CNNs) to assist the interpretation of Gram stains from PBCs for routine
  laboratory use. The CNN was trained to classify images of Gram stains based on staining
