description: AlphaFold2 (AF2) provides a 3D structure for every known or predicted
  protein, opening up new prospects for virtually every field in structural biology.
  However, working with transmembrane protein molecules pose a notorious challenge
  for scientists, resulting in a limited number of experimentally determined structures.
  Consequently, algorithms trained on this finite training set also face difficulties.
  To address this issue, we recently launched the TmAlphaFold database, where ...
