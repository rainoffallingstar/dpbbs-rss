description: Autoimmune cytopenia (AIC) in children may be associated with positive
  antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and may progress to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
  We evaluated the risk of progression to SLE of childhood-onset ANA-associated AIC.
  In the French national prospective OBS'CEREVANCE cohort, the long-term outcome of
  children with ANA-associated AIC (ANA titer ≥ 1/160) and the subgroup of children
  who developed SLE were described. ANA were positive in 355/1803 (20%) children with
  AIC. With ...
