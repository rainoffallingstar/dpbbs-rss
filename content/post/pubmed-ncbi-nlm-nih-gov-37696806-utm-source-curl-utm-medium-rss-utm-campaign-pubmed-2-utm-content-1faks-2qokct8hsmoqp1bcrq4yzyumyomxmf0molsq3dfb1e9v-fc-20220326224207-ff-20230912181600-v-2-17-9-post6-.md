description: The "eat me" signal, phosphatidylserine is exposed on the surface of
  dying cells by phospholipid scrambling. Previously, we showed that the Xkr family
  protein Xkr4 is activated by caspase-mediated cleavage and binding of the XRCC4
  fragment. Here, we show that extracellular calcium is an additional factor needed
  to activate Xkr4. The constitutively active mutant of Xkr4 is found to induce phospholipid
  scrambling in an extracellular, but not intracellular, calcium-dependent manner.
