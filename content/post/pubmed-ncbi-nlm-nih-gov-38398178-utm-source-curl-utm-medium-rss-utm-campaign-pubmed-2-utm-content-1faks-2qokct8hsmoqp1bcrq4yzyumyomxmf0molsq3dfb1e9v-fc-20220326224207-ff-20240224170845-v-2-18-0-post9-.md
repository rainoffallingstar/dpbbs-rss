description: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) can be
  histologically similar. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and
  thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) are commonly used to differentiate MCC from
  SCLC; however, these markers have limited sensitivity and specificity. To identify
  new diagnostic markers, we performed differential gene expression analysis on transcriptome
  data from MCC and SCLC tumors. Candidate markers included atonal BHLH transcription
  factor ...
