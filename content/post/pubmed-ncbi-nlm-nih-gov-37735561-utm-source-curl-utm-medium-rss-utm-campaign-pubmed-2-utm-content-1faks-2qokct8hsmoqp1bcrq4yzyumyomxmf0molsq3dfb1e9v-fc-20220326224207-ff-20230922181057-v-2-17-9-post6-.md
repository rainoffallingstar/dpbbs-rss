description: Substitution of lysine 27 to methionine in histone H3 (H3K27M) defines
  an aggressive subtype of diffuse glioma. Previous studies have shown that a H3K27M-specific
  long peptide vaccine (H3K27M-vac) induces mutation-specific immune responses that
  control H3K27M^(+) tumors in major histocompatibility complex-humanized mice. Here
  we describe a first-in-human treatment with H3K27M-vac of eight adult patients with
  progressive H3K27M^(+) diffuse midline glioma on a compassionate use basis. ...
