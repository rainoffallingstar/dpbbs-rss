description: The calcium-dependent serine endoprotease PACE4 is evaluated as a therapeutic
  target for prostate cancer. The peptide Ac-[d-Leu]LLLRVK-amba inhibits PACE4 with
  high affinity and has shown efficacy in preclinical mice xenograft models of prostate
  cancer. To support in vivo examinations of the potential therapeutic peptide Ac-[d-Leu]LLLRVK-amba,
  we established a highly sensitive assay for its quantification in mouse whole blood
  microsamples based on UPLC-MS/MS determination. Ac-[d-Leu]LLLRVK-amba... ...
