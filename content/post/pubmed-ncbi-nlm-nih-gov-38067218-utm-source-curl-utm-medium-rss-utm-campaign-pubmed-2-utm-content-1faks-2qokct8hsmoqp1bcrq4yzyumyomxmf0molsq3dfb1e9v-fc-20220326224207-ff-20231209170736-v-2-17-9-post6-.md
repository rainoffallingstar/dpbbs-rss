description: The C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) is expressed on platelets
  and mediates binding to podoplanin (PDPN) on various cell types. The binding to
  circulating tumor cells (CTCs) leads to platelet activation and promotes metastatic
  spread. An increased level of soluble CLEC-2 (sCLEC-2), presumably released from
  activated platelets, was shown in patients with thromboinflammatory and malignant
  disease. However, the functional role of sCLEC-2 and the mechanism of sCLEC-2 release
  are not known. ...
