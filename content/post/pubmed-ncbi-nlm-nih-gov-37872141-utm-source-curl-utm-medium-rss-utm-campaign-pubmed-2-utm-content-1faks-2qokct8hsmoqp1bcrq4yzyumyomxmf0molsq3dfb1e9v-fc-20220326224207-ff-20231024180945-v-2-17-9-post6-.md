description: Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease manifesting as bloodstream
  infection with high mortality is responsible for a huge public health burden in
  sub-Saharan Africa. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is
  the main cause of iNTS disease in Africa. By analysing whole genome sequence data
  from 1303 S. Typhimurium isolates originating from 19 African countries and isolated
  between 1979 and 2017, here we show a thorough scaled appraisal of the population
  structure ...
