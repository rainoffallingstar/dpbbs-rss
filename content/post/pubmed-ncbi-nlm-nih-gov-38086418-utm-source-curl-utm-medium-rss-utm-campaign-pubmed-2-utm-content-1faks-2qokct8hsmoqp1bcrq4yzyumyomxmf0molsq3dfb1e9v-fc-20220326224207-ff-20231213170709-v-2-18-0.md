description: Enhancers control gene expression and play crucial roles in development
  and homeostasis^(1-3). However, the targeted de novo design of enhancers with tissue-specific
  activities has remained challenging. Here, we combine deep learning and transfer
  learning to design tissue-specific enhancers for five tissues in the Drosophila
  melanogaster embryo - the central nervous system (CNS), epidermis, gut, muscle,
  and brain. We first train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using genome-wide
