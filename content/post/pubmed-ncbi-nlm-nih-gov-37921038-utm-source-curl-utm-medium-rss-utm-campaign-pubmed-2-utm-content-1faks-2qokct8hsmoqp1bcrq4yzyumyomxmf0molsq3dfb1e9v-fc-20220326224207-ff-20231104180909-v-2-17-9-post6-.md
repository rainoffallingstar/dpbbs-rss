description: The rixosome defined in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and humans performs
  diverse roles in pre-ribosomal RNA processing and gene silencing. Here, we isolate
  and describe the conserved rixosome from Chaetomium thermophilum, which consists
  of two sub-modules, the sphere-like Rix1-Ipi3-Ipi1 and the butterfly-like Las1-Grc3
  complex, connected by a flexible linker. The Rix1 complex of the rixosome utilizes
  Sda1 as landing platform on nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles to wedge between the
  5S rRNA tip ...
