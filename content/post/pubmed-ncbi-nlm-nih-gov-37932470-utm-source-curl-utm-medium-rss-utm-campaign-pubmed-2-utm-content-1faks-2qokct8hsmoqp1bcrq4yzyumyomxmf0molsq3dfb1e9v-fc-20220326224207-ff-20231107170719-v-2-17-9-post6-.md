description: Placental malaria vaccines (PMVs) are being developed to prevent severe
  sequelae of placental malaria (PM) in pregnant women and their offspring. The leading
  candidate vaccine antigen VAR2CSA mediates parasite binding to placental receptor
  chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Despite promising results in small animal studies,
  recent human trials of the first two PMV candidates (PAMVAC and PRIMVAC) generated
  limited cross-reactivity and cross-inhibitory activity to heterologous parasites.
