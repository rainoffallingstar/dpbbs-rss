description: In a recently published study a new genetic hypothesis was established
  that explained the existence of CTNNB1 mutations in Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal
  carcinomas (MLH1-LS-CRC). This hypothesis states that a mitotic recombination on
  chromosome 3p simultaneously leads to inactivation of the mismatch repair gene MLH1
  and to the activation of CTNNB1. This explains the increased frequency of CTNNB1
  mutations in MLH1-LS-CRC compared with other colon carcinomas. To test this ...
