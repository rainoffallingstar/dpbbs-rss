description: Iron is an essential nutrient required by all cells but used primarily
  for red blood cell production. Because humans have no effective mechanism for ridding
  the body of excess iron, the absorption of dietary iron must be precisely regulated.
  The critical site of regulation is the transfer of iron from the absorptive enterocyte
  to the portal circulation via the sole iron efflux transporter, ferroportin. Here
  we report that poly(rC)-binding protein 1 (PCBP1), the major cytosolic iron chaperone,
