description: Recent work has shown that field desorption (FD) and field ionization
  (FI) using activated field emitters may be performed at atmospheric pressure, too.
  While some limitations apply to atmospheric pressure field desorption (APFD) mass
  spectrometry (MS), the method can deliver both positive and negative even electron
  ions of highly polar or ionic compounds. Furthermore, APFD even permits the generation
  of positive molecular ions of polycyclic aromatic compounds. Here, an application
