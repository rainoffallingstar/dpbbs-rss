description: In this work, we report a series of noble metal (Ag, Au, Pt, etc.) sulfides
  that act as co-catalysts anchoring on CdS nanorods (NRs) obtained via a cation exchange
  strategy to promote photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. CdS NRs are first generated
  via a hydrothermal routine, noble metal sulfides are then in-situ grown on CdS NRs
  by a cation exchange method. CdS/Ag(2)S, CdS/Au(2)S and CdS/PtS NRs show improved
  hydrogen production rates (2506.88, 1513.17 and 1004.54 μmol ...
