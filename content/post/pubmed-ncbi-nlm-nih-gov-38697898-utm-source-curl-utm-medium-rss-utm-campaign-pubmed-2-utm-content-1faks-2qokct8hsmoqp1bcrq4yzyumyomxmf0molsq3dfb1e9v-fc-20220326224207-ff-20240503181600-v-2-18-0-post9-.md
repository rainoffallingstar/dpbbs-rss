description: Cilia and Wnt signaling have a complex relationship, wherein Wnt regulates
  cilia and, conversely, cilia may affect Wnt signaling. Recently, it was shown that
  Wnt receptors are present in flagella, primary cilia, and multicilia, where they
  transmit an intraciliary signal that is independent of β-catenin. Intraciliary Wnt
  signaling promotes ciliogenesis, affecting male fertility, adipogenesis, and mucociliary
  clearance. Wnt also stimulates the beating of motile cilia, highlighting that ...
