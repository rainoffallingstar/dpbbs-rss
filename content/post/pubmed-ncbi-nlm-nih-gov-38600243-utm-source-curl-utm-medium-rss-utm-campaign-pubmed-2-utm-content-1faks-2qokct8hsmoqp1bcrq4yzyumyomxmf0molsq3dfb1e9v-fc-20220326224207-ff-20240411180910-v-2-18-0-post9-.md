description: The γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) is a structural template for de novo
  microtubule assembly from α/β-tubulin units. The isolated vertebrate γ-TuRC assumes
  an asymmetric, open structure deviating from microtubule geometry, suggesting that
  γ-TuRC closure may underlie regulation of microtubule nucleation. Here, we isolate
  native γ-TuRC-capped microtubules from Xenopus laevis egg extract nucleated through
  the RanGTP-induced pathway for spindle assembly and determine their cryo-EM ...
