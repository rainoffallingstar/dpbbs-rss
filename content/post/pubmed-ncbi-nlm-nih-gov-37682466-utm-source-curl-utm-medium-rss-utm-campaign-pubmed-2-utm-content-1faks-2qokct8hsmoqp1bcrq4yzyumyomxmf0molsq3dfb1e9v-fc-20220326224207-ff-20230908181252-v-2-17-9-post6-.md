description: 'Inducible, tissue-specific gene expression is a potent tool to study
  gene regulatory networks as it allows spatially and temporally controlled genetic
  perturbations. To this end, we generated a toolkit that covers many cell types in
  the three main meristems: the root apical meristem, the shoot apical meristem, and
  the vascular cambium. The system is based on an extensive set of driver lines expressing
  a synthetic transcription factor under cell type-specific promoters. Induction leads
