description: Disposable handheld nerve stimulators are widely used in peripheral nerve
  surgery. Such devices stimulate a motor nerve or the motor component of a mixed
  nerve by applying electrical current to the proximal region, targeting the main
  nerve trunk. This stimulation then travels along the motor nerve, reaching the distal
  end to control the corresponding muscle(s). In this study, the authors demonstrate
  three useful tips and tricks for handheld nerve stimulation during targeted muscle
