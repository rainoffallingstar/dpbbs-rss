description: miR-Blood is a high-quality, small RNA expression atlas for the major
  components of human peripheral blood (plasma, erythrocytes, thrombocytes, monocytes,
  neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, natural killer cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T
  cells, and B cells). Based on the purified blood components from 52 individuals,
  the dataset provides a comprehensive repository for the expression of 4971 small
  RNAs from eight non-coding RNA ...
