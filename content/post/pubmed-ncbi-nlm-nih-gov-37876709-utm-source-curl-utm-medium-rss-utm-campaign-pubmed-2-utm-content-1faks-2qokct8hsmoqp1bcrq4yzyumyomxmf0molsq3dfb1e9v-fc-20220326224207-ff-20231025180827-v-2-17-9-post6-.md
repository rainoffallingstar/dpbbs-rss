description: The main function of articular cartilage is to provide a low friction
  surface and protect the underlying subchondral bone. The extracellular matrix composition
  of articular cartilage mainly consists of glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II.
  Specifically, collagen type II fibers have an arch-like organization that can be
  mimicked with segments of a hypotrochoidal curve. In this study, a script was developed
  that allowed the fabrication of scaffolds with a hypotrochoidal design. This design
