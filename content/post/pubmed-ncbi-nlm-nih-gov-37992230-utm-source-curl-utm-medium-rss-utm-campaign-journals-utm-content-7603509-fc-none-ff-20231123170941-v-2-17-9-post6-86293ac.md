description: Genomic instability contributes to cancer progression and is at least
  partly due to dysregulated homologous recombination. Here, we show that an elevated
  level of ABL1 kinase overactivates the HR pathway and causes genomic instability
  in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Inhibiting ABL1 with either shRNA or a pharmacological
  inhibitor (nilotinib) inhibits HR activity, reduces genomic instability, and slows
  MM cell growth. Moreover, inhibiting ABL1 rescues the HR dysregulation and genomic
