description: The hepatic content of amyloid beta (Aβ) decreases drastically in human
  and rodent cirrhosis highlighting the importance of understanding the consequences
  of Aβ deficiency in the liver. This is especially relevant in view of recent advances
  in anti-Aβ therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, it is shown that partial
  hepatic loss of Aβ in transgenic AD mice immunized with Aβ antibody 3D6 and its
  absence in amyloid precursor protein (APP) knockout mice (APP-KO), as well as in
  human ...
