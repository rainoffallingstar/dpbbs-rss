description: The combination of toripalimab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) with definitive
  chemoradiotherapy (CRT) demonstrated encouraging efficacy against locally advanced
  esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the EC-CRT-001 phase II trial (NCT04005170).
  The primary endpoint of this trial was the clinical complete response rate (cCR),
  and the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival
  (PFS), duration of response, and quality of life. The exploratory analyses of ...
