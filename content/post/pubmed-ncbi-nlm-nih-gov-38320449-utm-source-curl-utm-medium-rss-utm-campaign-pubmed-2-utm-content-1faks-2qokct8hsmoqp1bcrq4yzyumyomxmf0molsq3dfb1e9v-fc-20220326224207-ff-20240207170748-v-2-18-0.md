description: J-domain proteins (JDPs) are the largest family of chaperones in most
  organisms, but much of how they function within the network of other chaperones
  and protein quality control machineries is still an enigma. Here, we report on the
  latest findings related to JDP functions presented at a dedicated JDP workshop in
  Gdansk, Poland. The report does not include all (details) of what was shared and
  discussed at the meeting, because some of these original data have not yet been
  accepted for ...
