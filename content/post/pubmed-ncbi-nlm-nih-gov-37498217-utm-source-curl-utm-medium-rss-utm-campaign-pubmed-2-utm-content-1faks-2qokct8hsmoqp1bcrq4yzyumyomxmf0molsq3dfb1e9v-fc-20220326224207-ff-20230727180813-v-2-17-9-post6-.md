description: Design strategies for DNA and RNA nanostructures have developed along
  parallel lines for the past 30 years, from small structural motifs derived from
  biology to large 'origami' structures with thousands to tens of thousands of bases.
  With the recent publication of numerous RNA origami structures and improved design
  methods-even permitting co-transcriptional folding of kilobase-sized structures
  - the RNA nanotechnolgy field is at an inflection point. Here, we review the key
