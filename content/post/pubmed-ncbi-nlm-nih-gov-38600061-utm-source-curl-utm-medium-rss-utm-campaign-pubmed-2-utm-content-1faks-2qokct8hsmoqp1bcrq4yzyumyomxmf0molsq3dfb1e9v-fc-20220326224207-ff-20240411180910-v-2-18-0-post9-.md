description: Formation of organo-typical vascular networks requires cross-talk between
  differentiating parenchymal cells and developing blood vessels. Here we identify
  a Vegfa driven venous sprouting process involving parenchymal to vein cross-talk
  regulating venous endothelial Vegfa signaling strength and subsequent formation
  of a specialized angiogenic cell, prefabricated with an intact lumen and pericyte
  coverage, termed L-Tip cell. L-Tip cell selection in the venous domain requires
