description: Posterior circulation infarcts comprise approximately 25% of ischemic
  strokes but are less often treated with recanalization therapy and have longer treatment
  delays compared with anterior circulation strokes. Among posterior circulation strokes,
  basilar artery occlusion is associated with the most severe deficits and the worst
  prognosis. Endovascular thrombectomy is a standard of care for patients with anterior
  circulation large vessel occlusion, but not until recently were the first ...
