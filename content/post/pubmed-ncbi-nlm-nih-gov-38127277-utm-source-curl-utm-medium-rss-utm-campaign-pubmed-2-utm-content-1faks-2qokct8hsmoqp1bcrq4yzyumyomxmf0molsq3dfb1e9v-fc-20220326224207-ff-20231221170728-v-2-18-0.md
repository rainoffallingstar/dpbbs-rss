description: 18F- fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a valuable
  prognostic tool in modern lymphoma care. In this study, we explored the utility
  of quantitative FDG-PET parameters in predicting the histology of suspected relapsed/refractory
  (R/R) lymphoma. We retrospectively analyzed 290 FDG-PET scans performed for suspected
  R/R lymphoma. FDG-PET parameters measured were maximum and mean Standardized Uptake
  Value (SUVMax, SUVMean), Total Metabolic Tumor Volume and Total ...
