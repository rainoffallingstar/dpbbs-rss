description: Missense variants in the MBTPS2 gene, located on the X chromosome, have
  been associated with an X-linked recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta (X-OI),
  an inherited bone dysplasia characterized by multiple and recurrent bone fractures,
  short stature, and various skeletal deformities in affected individuals. The role
  of site-2 protease, encoded by MBTPS2, and the molecular pathomechanism underlying
  the disease is to date elusive. This study is the first to report on the generation
