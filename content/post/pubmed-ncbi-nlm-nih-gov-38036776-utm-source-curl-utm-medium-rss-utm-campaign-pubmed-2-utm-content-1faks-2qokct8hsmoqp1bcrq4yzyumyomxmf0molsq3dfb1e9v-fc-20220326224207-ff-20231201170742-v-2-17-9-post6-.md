description: Loss-of-function variants of SCN5A, encoding the sodium channel alpha
  subunit Nav1.5 are associated with high phenotypic variability and multiple cardiac
  presentations, while underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here we
  investigated a family with individuals affected by Brugada Syndrome (BrS) of different
  severity and aimed to unravel the underlying genetic and electrophysiological basis.Next-generation
  sequencing was used to identify the genetic variants carried by family ...
