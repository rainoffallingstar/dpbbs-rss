description: The developing brain has a well-organized anatomical structure comprising
  different types of neural and non-neural cells. Stem cells, progenitors and newborn
  neurons tightly interact with their neighbouring cells and tissue microenvironment,
  and this intricate interplay ultimately shapes the output of neurogenesis. Given
  the relevance of spatial cues during brain development, we acknowledge the necessity
  for a spatial transcriptomics map accessible to the neurodevelopmental community.
