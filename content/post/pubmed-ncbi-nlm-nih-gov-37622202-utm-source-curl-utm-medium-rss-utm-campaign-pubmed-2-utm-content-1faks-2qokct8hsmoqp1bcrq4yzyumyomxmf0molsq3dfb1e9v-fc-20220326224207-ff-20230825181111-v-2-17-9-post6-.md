description: Mucous membrane pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized
  by predominant involvement of surface-close epithelia and linear depositions of
  immunoreactants at the dermal-epithelial junction on direct immunofluorescence microscopy.
  A major diagnostic difficulty is the frequent need for multiple biopsies to facilitate
  the diagnosis. Although oesophageal involvement is a rare, but life-threatening
  manifestation, the relevance of oesophageal direct immunofluorescence sampling ...
