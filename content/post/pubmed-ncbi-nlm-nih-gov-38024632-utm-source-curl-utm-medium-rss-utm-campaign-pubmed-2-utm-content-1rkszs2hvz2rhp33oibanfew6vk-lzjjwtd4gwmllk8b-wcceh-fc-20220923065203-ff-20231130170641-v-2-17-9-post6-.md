description: TP53 aberrations constitute the highest risk subset of myelodysplastic
  neoplasms (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The International Consensus Classification
  questions the blast threshold between MDS and AML. In this study, we assess the
  distinction between MDS and AML for 76 patients with TP53 aberrations. We observed
  no significant differences between MDS and AML regarding TP53 genomics. Median overall
  survival (OS) was 223 days for the entire group, but prognostic discrimination ...
