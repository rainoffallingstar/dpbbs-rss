  methodological limitations, suggest that macular drusen and parapapillary drusen
  shared the morphological feature of periodic-acid-Schiff-positive material between
  the RPE basal membrane and BM and that they did not vary significantly in choriocapillaris
  thickness and density. RPE cell density and BM thickness were higher in parapapillary
  drusen than in macular ...'
