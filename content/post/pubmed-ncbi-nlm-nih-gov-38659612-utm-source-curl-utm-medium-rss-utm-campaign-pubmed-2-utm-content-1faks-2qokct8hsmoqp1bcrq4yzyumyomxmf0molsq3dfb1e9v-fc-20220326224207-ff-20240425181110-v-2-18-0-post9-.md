description: The radius valley (or gap) in the observed distribution of exoplanet
  radii, which separates smaller super-Earths from larger sub-Neptunes, is a key feature
  that theoretical models must explain. Conventionally, it is interpreted as the result
  of the loss of primordial hydrogen and helium (H/He) envelopes atop rocky cores.
  However, planet formation models predict that water-rich planets migrate from cold
  regions outside the snowline towards the star. Assuming water to be in the form
  of solid ...
