description: 'CONCLUSION: We provide first evidence on a range of circulating oxysterols
  and mortality following a breast cancer diagnosis, contributing to a better understanding
  of associations between different pathways of cholesterol metabolism and prognosis
  in women with a breast cancer diagnosis. The findings of this study suggest circulating

  with breast cancer. Further studies are needed to evaluate these oxysterols ...'
