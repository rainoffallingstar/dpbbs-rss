description: Intraoperative antithrombotic drug removal by haemoadsorption is a novel
  strategy to reduce perioperative bleeding in patients on antithrombotic drugs undergoing
  cardiac surgery. The international STAR registry reports real-world clinical outcomes
  associated with this application. All patients underwent cardiac surgery before
  completing the recommended washout period. The haemoadsorption device was incorporated
