description: Due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the data, the analysis
  of spatial transcriptome data has been a challenging problem. Meanwhile, cluster
  analysis is the core issue of the analysis of spatial transcriptome data. In this
  article, a deep learning approach is proposed based on graph attention networks
  for clustering analysis of spatial transcriptome data. Our method first enhances
  the spatial transcriptome data, then uses graph attention networks to extract features
  from nodes, ...
