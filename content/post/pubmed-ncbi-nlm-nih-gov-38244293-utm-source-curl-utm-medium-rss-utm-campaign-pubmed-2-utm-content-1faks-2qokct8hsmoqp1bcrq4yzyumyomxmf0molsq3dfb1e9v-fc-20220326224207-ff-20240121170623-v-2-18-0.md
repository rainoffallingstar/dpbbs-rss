description: 'BACKGROUND: Chronic cough is a prevalent and difficult to treat condition
  often accompanied by cough hypersensitivity, characterised by cough triggered from
  exposure to low level sensory stimuli. The mechanisms underlying cough hypersensitivity
  may involve alterations in airway sensory nerve responsivity to tussive stimuli
  which would be accompanied by alterations in stimulus-induced brainstem activation,
  measurable with functional magnetic resonance imaging ...'
