description: Histiocytoses are inflammatory myeloid neoplasms often driven by somatic
  activating mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade genes. H
  syndrome is an inflammatory genetic disorder caused by germline loss-of-function
  mutations in SLC29A3, encoding the lysosomal equilibrative nucleoside transporter
  3 (ENT3). Patients with H syndrome are predisposed to develop histiocytosis, yet
  the mechanism is unclear. Here, through phenotypic, molecular and functional analysis
