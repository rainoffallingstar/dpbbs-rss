  acquire the properties of stem cells. During mouse skin wound healing, the differentiated
  Gata6-lineage positive cells of the sebaceous duct are able to dedifferentiate.
  Here we have integrated lineage tracing and single-cell mRNA sequencing to uncover
  the underlying mechanism. Gata6-lineage positive and negative epidermal stem cells
  in wounds are transcriptionally indistinguishable. Furthermore, in contrast ...
