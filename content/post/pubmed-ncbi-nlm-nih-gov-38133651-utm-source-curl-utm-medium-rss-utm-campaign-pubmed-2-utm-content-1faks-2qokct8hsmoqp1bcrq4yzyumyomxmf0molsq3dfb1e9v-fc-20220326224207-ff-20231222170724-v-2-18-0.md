description: Polyurethanes are synthesized on industrial scale by the reaction of
  diisocyanates with diols in the presence of catalysts which are commonly based on
  tin complexes and amines. However, due to the toxicity and volatility of these tin
  catalysts and amines, there is the need to develop new catalysts that are more environmentally
  benign. Herein, we report the synthesis of O^N^O pincer-ligated Mn(III) and Fe(III)
  complexes that serve as suitable catalysts for urethane formation and are stable
