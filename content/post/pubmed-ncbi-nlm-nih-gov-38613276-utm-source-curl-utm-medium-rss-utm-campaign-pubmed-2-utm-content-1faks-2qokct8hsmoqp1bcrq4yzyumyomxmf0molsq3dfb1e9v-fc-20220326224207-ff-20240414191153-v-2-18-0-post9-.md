description: An amplitude analysis of the B^{0}→K^{*0}μ^{+}μ^{-} decay is presented
  using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb^{-1} of pp collision
  data collected with the LHCb experiment. For the first time, the coefficients associated
  to short-distance physics effects, sensitive to processes beyond the standard model,
  are extracted directly from the data through a q^{2}-unbinned amplitude analysis,
  where q^{2} is the μ^{+}μ^{-} invariant mass squared. Long-distance ...
