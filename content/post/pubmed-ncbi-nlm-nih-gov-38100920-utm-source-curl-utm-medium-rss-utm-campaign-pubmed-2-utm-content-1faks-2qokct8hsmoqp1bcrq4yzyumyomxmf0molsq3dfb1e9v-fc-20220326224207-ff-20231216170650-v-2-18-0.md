CONCLUSIONS: TTF-1 status predicts relapse and survival in LUAD independently of tumor grading. The prognostic power of tumor grading is limited to TTF-1-positive patients, and the effect size of TTF-1 surpasses that of tumor grading. We recommend including TTF1 status as a prognostic factor in the diagnostic guidelines of ...
