description: The expansion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts not only suppresses
  normal hematopoiesis, but also alters the microenvironment. The interplay of different
  components of the bone marrow gives rise to altered metabolic states and activates
  signaling pathways which lead to resistance and impede effective therapy. Therefore,
  the underlying processes and mechanisms represent attractive therapeutic leverage
  points for overcoming therapy resistance in AML. Here, we briefly discuss ...
