description: The aim of this study was to reduce discrepancies between students and
  instructors in a preclinical dental course by employing structured peer feedback
  based on a detailed evaluation sheet. In a crossover study of dental students (n
  = 32), which compared peer feedback using an evaluation sheet (test) with the traditional
  method (control), participants completed tasks involving cavity and partial crown
  preparation. The practical tasks were scored numerically on a scale ranging from
