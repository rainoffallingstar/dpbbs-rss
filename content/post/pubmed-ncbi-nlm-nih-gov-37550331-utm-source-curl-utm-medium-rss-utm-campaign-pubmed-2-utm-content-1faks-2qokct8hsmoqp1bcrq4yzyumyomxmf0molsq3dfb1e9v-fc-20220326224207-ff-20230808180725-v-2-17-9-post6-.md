description: The role of iron in the two major sites of adaptive thermogenesis, namely
  the beige inguinal (iWAT) and brown adipose tissues (BAT) has not been fully understood
  yet. Body iron levels and distribution is controlled by the iron regulatory peptide
  hepcidin. Here, we explored iron homeostasis and thermogenic activity in brown and
  beige fat in wild-type and iron loaded Hepcidin KO mice. Hepcidin-deficient mice
  displayed iron overload in both iWAT and BAT, and preferential accumulation of ferritin
