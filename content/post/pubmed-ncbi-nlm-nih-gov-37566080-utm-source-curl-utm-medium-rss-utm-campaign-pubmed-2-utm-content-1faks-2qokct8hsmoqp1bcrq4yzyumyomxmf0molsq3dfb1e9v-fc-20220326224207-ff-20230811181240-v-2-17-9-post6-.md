description: In this study, we delve into the impact of genotoxic anticancer drug
  treatment on the chromatin structure of human cells, with a particular focus on
  the effects of doxorubicin. Using Hi-C, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq, we explore the changes
  in chromatin architecture brought about by doxorubicin and ICRF193. Our results
  indicate that physiologically relevant doses of doxorubicin lead to a local reduction
  in Hi-C interactions in certain genomic regions that contain active promoters, with
  changes ...
