description: '(1) Background: The sensitivity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
  (HNSCC) to ionizing radiation, among others, is determined by the number of cells
  with high clonogenic potential and stem-like features. These cellular characteristics
  are dynamically regulated in response to treatment and may lead to an enrichment
  of radioresistant cells with a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. Epigenetic mechanisms,
  particularly DNA and histone methylation, are key regulators of ...'
