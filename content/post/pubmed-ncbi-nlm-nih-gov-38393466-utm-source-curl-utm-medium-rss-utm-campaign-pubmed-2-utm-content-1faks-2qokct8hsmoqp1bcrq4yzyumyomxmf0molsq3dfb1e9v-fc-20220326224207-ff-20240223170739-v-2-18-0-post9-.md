description: Proteins drive genome compartmentalization across different length scales.
  While the identities of these proteins have been well-studied, the physical mechanisms
  that drive genome organization have remained largely elusive. Studying these mechanisms
  is challenging owing to a lack of methodologies to parametrize physical models in
  cellular contexts. Furthermore, because of the complex, entangled, and dense nature
  of chromatin, conventional live imaging approaches often lack the spatial ...
