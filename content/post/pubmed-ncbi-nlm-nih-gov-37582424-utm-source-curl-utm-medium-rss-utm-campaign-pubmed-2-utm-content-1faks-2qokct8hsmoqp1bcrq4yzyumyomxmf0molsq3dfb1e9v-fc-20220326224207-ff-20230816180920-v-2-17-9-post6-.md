description: 'BACKGROUND: Pulmonary involvement is the leading cause of death in systemic
  sclerosis (SSc) and may manifest as interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary arterial
  hypertension (PAH), or in combination of both (ILD-pulmonary hypertension (PH)).
  Aim of this analysis was to determine prevalence, clinical characteristics, and
  survival of these different forms within the registry of the German Network for
  Systemic Sclerosis ...'
