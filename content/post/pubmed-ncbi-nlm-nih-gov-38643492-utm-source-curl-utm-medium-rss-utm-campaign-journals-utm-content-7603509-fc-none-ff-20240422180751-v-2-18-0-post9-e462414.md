description: Secondary kinase domain mutations in BCR::ABL1 represent the most common
  cause of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in chronic myeloid
  leukemia patients. The first five approved BCR::ABL1 TKIs target the ATP-binding
  pocket. Mutations confer resistance to these ATP-competitive TKIs and those approved
  for other malignancies by decreasing TKI affinity and/or increasing ATP affinity.
