description: Accurate species identification is crucial to assess the medical relevance
  of a mosquito specimen, but requires intensive experience of the observers and well-equipped
  laboratories. In this proof-of-concept study, we developed a convolutional neural
  network (CNN) to identify seven Aedes species by wing images, only. While previous
  studies used images of the whole mosquito body, the nearly two-dimensional wings
  may facilitate standardized image capture and reduce the complexity of the ...
