description: As the progression of low-grade diffuse astrocytomas into grade 4 tumors
  significantly impacts patient prognosis, a better understanding of this process
  is of paramount importance for improved patient care. In this project, we analyzed
  matched IDH-mutant astrocytomas before and after progression to grade 4 from six
  patients (discovery cohort) with genome-wide sequencing, 21 additional patients
  with targeted sequencing, and 33 patients from Glioma Longitudinal AnalySiS cohort
  for validation. ...
