description: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare but fatal disease if
  untreated, is due to alteration in Von Willebrand factor cleavage resulting in capillary
  microthrombi formation and ischemic organ damage. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), has been
  shown to drive sterile inflammation following ischemia and could play an essential
  contribution to post-ischemic organ damage in TTP. Our objectives were to evaluate
  IL-1 involvement during TTP and to test the efficacy of the recombinant IL-1 ...
