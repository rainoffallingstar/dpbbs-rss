description: Multi-gene assays have been widely used to predict the recurrence risk
  for hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients. However, these assays
  lack explanatory power regarding the underlying mechanisms of the recurrence risk.
  To address this limitation, we proposed a novel multi-layered knowledge graph neural
  network for the multi-gene assays. Our model elucidated the regulatory pathways
  of assay genes and utilized an attention-based graph neural network to predict recurrence
