description: Anti-prothrombin (anti-PT) antibodies are found in antiphospholipid patients,
  but how they interact with prothrombin remains elusive. Prothrombin adopts closed
  and open forms. We recently discovered Type-I and Type-II antibodies and proposed
  that Type-I recognize the open form. In this study, we report the discovery, structural
  and functional characterization in human plasma of a Type-I antibody, POmAb. Using
  surface plasmon resonance and single-molecule spectroscopy, we show that ...
