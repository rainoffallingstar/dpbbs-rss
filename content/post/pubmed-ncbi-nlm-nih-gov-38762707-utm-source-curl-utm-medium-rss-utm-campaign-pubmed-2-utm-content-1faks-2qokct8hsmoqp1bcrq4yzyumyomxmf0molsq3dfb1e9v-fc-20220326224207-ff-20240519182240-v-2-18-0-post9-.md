description: An accurate diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is crucial, given
  the potential for high mortality in undetected cases. Strategic D-dimer testing
  may aid in identifying low-risk patients, preventing overdiagnosis and reducing
  imaging costs. We conducted a retrospective, comparative analysis to assess the
  potential cost savings that could be achieved by adopting different approaches to
  determine the most effective D-dimer cut-off value in cancer patients with suspected
  VTE, compared to ...
