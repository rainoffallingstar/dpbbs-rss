description: An extended theoretical analysis of the photodissociation dynamics of
  the four-carbon Criegee intermediate (CH(2)═CH(CH(3))COO) or methyl vinyl ketone
  oxide, which has four conformers, following excitation to the B state, is presented.
  Our analysis relies on multireference electronic wave functions combined with a
  wavepacket propagation treatment for the two coupled B¹A' and C¹A' electronic states
  and two nuclear degrees of freedom. For each conformer, the 2D model depends on
  potential ...
