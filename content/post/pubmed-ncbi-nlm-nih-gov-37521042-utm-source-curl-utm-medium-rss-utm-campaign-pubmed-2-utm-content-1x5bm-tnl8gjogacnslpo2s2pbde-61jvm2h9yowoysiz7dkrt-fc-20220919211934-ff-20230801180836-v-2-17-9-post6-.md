description: Functional heterogeneity of healthy human tissues complicates interpretation
  of molecular studies, impeding precision therapeutic target identification and treatment.
  Considering this, we generated a graph neural network with Reactome-based architecture
  and trained it using 9,115 samples from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx). Our graph
  neural network (GNN) achieves adjusted Rand index (ARI) = 0.7909, while a Resnet18
  control model achieves ARI = 0.7781, on 370 held-out healthy human ...
