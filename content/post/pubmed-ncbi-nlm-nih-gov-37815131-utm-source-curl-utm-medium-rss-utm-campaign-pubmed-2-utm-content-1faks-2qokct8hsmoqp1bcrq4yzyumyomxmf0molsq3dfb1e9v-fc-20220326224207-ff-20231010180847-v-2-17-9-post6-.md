description: The nonadiabatic photodynamics of all-trans linear polyenes with N =
  4-8 conjugated double bonds is studied from an electronic structure perspective.
  Excitation energies and stationary points for the 1B(u) and 2A(g) singlet states
  have been computed by using the state-average complete active space (SA-CASSCF)
  method and its second-order perturbation theory variant (MS-CASPT2). The dependence
  of the two low-lying excited states on the "chain length" N has been elucidated.
  In addition, ...
