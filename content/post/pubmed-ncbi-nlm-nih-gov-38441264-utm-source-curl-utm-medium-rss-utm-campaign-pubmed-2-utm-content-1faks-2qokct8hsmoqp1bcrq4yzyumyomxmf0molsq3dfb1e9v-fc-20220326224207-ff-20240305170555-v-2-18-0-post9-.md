description: Polaritonic states, which are formed by resonances between a molecular
  excitation and the photonic mode of a cavity, have a number of useful properties
  that offer new routes to control molecular photochemistry using electric fields.
  To provide a theoretical description of how polaritonic states affect the real-time
  electron dynamics in molecules, a new method is described where the effects of strong
  light-molecule coupling are implemented using real-time electronic structure theory.
