description: 'CONCLUSION: In circulating monocytes, major surgery does not globally
  affect MHC-II transcription but rather induces specific changes in the expression
  of selected HLA genes, followed by differential recovery patterns and accompanied
  by a prolonged reduction of CTCF expression and binding within the MHC-II region.
  Our results hint toward a long-lasting impact of a major surgical intervention on
  monocyte functionality, possibly mediated by epigenetic changes that endure the
