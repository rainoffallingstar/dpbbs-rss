description: The present study presents an alternative analytical workflow that combines
  mid-infrared (MIR) microscopic imaging and deep learning to diagnose human lymphoma
  and differentiate between small and large cell lymphoma. We could show that using
  a deep learning approach to analyze MIR hyperspectral data obtained from benign
  and malignant lymph node pathology results in high accuracy for correct classification,
  learning the distinct region of 3900 cm^(-1) to 850 cm^(-1) . The accuracy is above
