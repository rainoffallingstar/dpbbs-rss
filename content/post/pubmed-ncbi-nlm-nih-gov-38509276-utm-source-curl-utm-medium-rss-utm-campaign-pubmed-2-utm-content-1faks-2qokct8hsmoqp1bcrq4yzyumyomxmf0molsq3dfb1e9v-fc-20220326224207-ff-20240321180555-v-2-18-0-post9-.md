description: Stellar chemical compositions can be altered by ingestion of planetary
  material^(1,2) and/or planet formation, which removes refractory material from the
  protostellar disk^(3,4). These 'planet signatures' appear as correlations between
  elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature^(3,5,6). Detecting
  these planet signatures, however, is challenging owing to unknown occurrence rates,
  small amplitudes and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in ...
