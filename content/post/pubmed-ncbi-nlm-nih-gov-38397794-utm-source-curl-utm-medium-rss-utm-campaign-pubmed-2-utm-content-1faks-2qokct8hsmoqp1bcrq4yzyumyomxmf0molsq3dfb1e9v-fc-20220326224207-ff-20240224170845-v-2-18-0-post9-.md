description: Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death pathway that involves the
  depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and iron-mediated lipid peroxidation.
  Ferroptosis is experimentally caused by the inhibition of the cystine/glutamate
  antiporter xCT, which depletes cells of GSH, or by inhibition of glutathione peroxidase
  4 (GPx4), a key regulator of lipid peroxidation. The events that occur between GPx4
  inhibition and the execution of ferroptotic cell death are currently a matter of
