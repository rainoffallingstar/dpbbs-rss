description: Giant viruses (phylum Nucleocytoviricota) are globally distributed in
  aquatic ecosystems. They play fundamental roles as evolutionary drivers of eukaryotic
  plankton and regulators of global biogeochemical cycles. However, we lack knowledge
  about their native hosts, hindering our understanding of their life cycle and ecological
  importance. In the present study, we applied a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
  approach to samples collected during an induced algal bloom, which enabled ...
