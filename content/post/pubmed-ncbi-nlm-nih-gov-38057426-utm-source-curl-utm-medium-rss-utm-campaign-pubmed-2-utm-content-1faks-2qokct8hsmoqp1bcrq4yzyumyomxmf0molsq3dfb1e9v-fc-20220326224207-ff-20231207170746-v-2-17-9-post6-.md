description: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by mutations in SMN1. SMN2 is
  a paralogous gene with a C•G-to-T•A transition in exon 7, which causes this exon
  to be skipped in most SMN2 transcripts, and results in low levels of the protein
  survival motor neuron (SMN). Here we show, in fibroblasts derived from patients
  with SMA and in a mouse model of SMA that, irrespective of the mutations in SMN1,
  adenosine base editors can be optimized to target the SMN2 exon-7 mutation or nearby
  regulatory ...
