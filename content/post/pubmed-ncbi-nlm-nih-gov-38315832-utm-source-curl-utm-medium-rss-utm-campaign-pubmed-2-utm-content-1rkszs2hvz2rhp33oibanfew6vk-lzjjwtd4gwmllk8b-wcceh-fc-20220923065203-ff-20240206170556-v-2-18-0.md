description: In ZUMA-7 (NCT03391466), axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) significantly
  improved outcomes versus second-line (2L) standard of care (SOC) for adults with
  relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The optimal management of patients
  after disease progression or lack of response to 2L therapy remains unclear. Here,
  we report outcomes among patients who received subsequent anti-lymphoma therapy
  per investigator discretion separately by their randomized 2L arm in ZUMA-7. ...
