description: Inhibition of the interaction between MDM2 and p53 has emerged as a promising
  strategy for combating cancer, including the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). Numerous
  MDM2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently undergoing rigorous testing
  for their potential in GBM therapy. Encouraging results from studies conducted in
  cell culture and animal models suggest that MDM2 inhibitors could effectively treat
  a specific subset of GBM patients with wild-type TP53 or functional p53. ...
