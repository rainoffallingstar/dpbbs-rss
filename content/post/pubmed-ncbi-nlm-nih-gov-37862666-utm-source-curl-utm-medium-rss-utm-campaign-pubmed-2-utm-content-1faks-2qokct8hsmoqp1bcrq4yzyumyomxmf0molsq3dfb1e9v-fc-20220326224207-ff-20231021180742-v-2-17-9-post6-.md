description: We observe synchronization in a thermal (35-60 °C) atomic (Rb) ensemble
  driven to a highly excited Rydberg state (principle quantum number n ranging from
  43 to 79). Synchronization in this system is unexpected due to the atomic motion;
  however, we show theoretically that sufficiently strong interactions via a global
  Rydberg density mean field cause frequency and phase entrainment. The emergent oscillations
  in the vapor's bulk quantities are detected in the transmission of the probe laser
