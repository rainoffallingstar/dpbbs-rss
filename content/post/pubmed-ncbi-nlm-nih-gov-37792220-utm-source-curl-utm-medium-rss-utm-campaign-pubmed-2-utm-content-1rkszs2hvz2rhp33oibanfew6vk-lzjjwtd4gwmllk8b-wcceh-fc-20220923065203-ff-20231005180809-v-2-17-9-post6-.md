description: 'CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of prior non-CNS malignancy are
  at an overall increased risk of developing SPGBM relative to the incidence of developing
  GBM in the general population. However, the incidence of SPGBM after prior non-CNS
  malignancy varies by primary tumor location, with some non-CNS malignancies demonstrating
  either increased or decreased predisposition for SPGBM depending on tumor origin.
  These findings merit future investigation into whether these relationships ...'
