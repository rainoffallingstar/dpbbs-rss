description: Axon degeneration and functional decline in myelin diseases are often
  attributed to loss of myelin but their relation is not fully understood. Perturbed
  myelinating glia can instigate chronic neuroinflammation and contribute to demyelination
  and axonal damage. Here we study mice with distinct defects in the proteolipid protein
  1 gene that develop axonal damage which is driven by cytotoxic T cells targeting
  myelinating oligodendrocytes. We show that persistent ensheathment with perturbed
