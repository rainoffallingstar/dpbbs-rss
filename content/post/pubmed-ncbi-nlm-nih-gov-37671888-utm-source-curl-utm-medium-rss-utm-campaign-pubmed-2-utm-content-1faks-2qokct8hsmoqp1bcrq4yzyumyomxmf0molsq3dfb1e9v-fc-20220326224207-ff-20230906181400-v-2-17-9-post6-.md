description: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) particles secreted from cells are stable at 37°C,
  whether the producer cell media contain serum or not. Yet, we found that intracellular
  HCV particles harvested after freeze-thawing of producer cells are highly unstable
  upon resuspension in a serum-free medium, indicating that either HCV particles gain
  intrinsic stability during their secretion and egress from producer cells or, alternatively,
  that a factor secreted from cells can stabilize intrinsically unstable ...
