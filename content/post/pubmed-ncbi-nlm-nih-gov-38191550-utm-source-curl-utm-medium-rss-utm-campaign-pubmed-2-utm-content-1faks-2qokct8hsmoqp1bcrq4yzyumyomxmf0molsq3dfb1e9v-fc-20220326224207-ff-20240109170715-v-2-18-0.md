description: Medulloblastomas with extensive nodularity are cerebellar tumors characterized
  by two distinct compartments and variable disease progression. The mechanisms governing
  the balance between proliferation and differentiation in MBEN remain poorly understood.
  Here, we employ a multi-modal single cell transcriptome analysis to dissect this
  process. In the internodular compartment, we identify proliferating cerebellar granular
  neuronal precursor-like malignant cells, along with stromal, vascular, ...
