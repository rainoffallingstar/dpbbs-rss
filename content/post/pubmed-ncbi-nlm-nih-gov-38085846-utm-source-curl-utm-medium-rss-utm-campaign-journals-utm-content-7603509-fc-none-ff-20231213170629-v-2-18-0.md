description: Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized
  by complement pathway-mediated hemolysis. Riliprubart (SAR445088, BIVV020), a second-generation
  classical complement inhibitor, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively
  inhibits only the activated form of C1s. This Phase 1b study evaluated the safety,
  tolerability, and effect on hemolysis of riliprubart in adult patients with CAD.
  On Day 1, 12 patients received a single IV dose of either 30 mg/kg ...
