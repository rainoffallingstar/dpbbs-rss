description: 'CONCLUSION: The IRTQTPPI sequence, while providing a less intensive
  TQ signal than TQTPPI, allows a simultaneous and reliable quantification of both
  the T(1) -TQ signal and T(1) relaxation times. The unique sensitivities of the T(1)
  and T(2) relaxation pathways to different types of molecular motion provide a deeper
