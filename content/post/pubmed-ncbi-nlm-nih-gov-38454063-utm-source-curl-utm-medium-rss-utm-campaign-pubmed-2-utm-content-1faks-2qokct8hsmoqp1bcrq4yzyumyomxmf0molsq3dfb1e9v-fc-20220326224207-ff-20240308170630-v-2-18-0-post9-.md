description: Morphogenesis of multicellular organs requires coordination of cellular
  growth. In plants, cell growth is determined by turgor pressure and the mechanical
  properties of the cell wall, which also glues cells together. Because plants have
  to integrate tissue-scale mechanical stresses arising through growth in a fixed
  tissue topology, they need to monitor cell wall mechanical status and adapt growth
  accordingly. Molecular factors have been identified, but whether cell geometry contributes
  to ...
