description: This Letter presents the first study of Higgs boson production in association
  with a vector boson (V=W or Z) in the fully hadronic qqbb final state using data
  recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at sqrt[s]=13
  TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb^{-1}. The vector bosons
  and Higgs bosons are each reconstructed as large-radius jets and tagged using jet
  substructure techniques. Dedicated tagging algorithms exploiting b-tagging properties
