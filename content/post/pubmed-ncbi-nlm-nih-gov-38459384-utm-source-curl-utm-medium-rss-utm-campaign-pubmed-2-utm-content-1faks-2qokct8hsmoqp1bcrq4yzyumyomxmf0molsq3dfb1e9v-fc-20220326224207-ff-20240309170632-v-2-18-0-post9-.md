description: We developed a system for optogenetic release of single molecules in
  cells. We confined soluble and transmembrane proteins to the Golgi apparatus via
  a photocleavable protein and released them by short pulses of light. Our method
  allows for a light dose-dependent delivery of functional proteins to the cytosol
  and plasma membrane in amounts compatible with single-molecule imaging, greatly
  simplifying access to single-molecule microscopy of any protein in live cells. We
  were able to ...
