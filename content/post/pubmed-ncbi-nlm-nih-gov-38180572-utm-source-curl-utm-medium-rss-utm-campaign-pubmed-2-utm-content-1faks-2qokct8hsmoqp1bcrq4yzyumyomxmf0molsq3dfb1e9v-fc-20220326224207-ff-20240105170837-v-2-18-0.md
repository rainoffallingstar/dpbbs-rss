description: We describe here the molecular basis of the complex formation of PRUNE1
  with the tumor metastasis suppressors NME1 and NME2, two isoforms appertaining to
  the nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) enzyme family, and how this complex regulates
  signaling the immune system and energy metabolism, thereby shaping the tumor microenvironment
  (TME). Disrupting the interaction between NME1/2 and PRUNE1, as suggested, holds
  the potential to be an excellent therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer
