description: Large placebo-controlled clinical trials have shown that sodium-glucose
  cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) delay the deterioration of renal function and
  reduce cardiovascular events in a glucose-independent manner, thereby ultimately
  reducing mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or heart failure.
  These exiting clinical data stimulated preclinical studies aiming to understand
  the observed clinical effects. In animal models, it was shown that the beneficial
  effect of ...
