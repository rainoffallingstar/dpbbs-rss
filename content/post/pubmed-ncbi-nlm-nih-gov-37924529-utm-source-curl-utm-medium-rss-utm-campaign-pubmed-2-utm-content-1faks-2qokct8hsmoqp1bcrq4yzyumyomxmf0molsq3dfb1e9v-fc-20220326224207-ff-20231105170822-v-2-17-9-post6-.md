description: Intratumoural as well as systemic inflammation in melanoma has thoroughly
  been studied in the context of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors
  but not with BRAF/MEK inhibitors (BRAFi/MEKi). We aimed to study whether parameters
  of intratumoral and systemic inflammation correlate with clinical outcome in patients
  with BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma treated with BRAFi/MEKi. We studied 51 CM patients
  with unresectable stage III or IV who had the indication for BRAFi/MEKi ...
