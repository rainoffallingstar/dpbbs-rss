description: The first example of intramolecular nucleophilic addition of 1,4-diazabutatriene
  to ester is disclosed. This approach provides a facile and versatile synthesis for
  functionalized 2H-1,4-benzoxazines under metal-, reagent-, and solvent-free conditions.
  Experimental and computational studies revealed the pivotal role of 1,5-acyl migration
  as the self-catalytic step in the reaction ...
