description: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) describes the outsized contribution of expanded
  clones of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to blood cell production.
  The prevalence of CH increases dramatically with age. CH can be caused by somatic
  mutations in individual genes or by gains and or losses of larger chromosomal segments.
  CH is a premalignant state; the somatic mutations detected in CH are the initiating
  mutations for hematologic malignancies, and CH is a strong predictor for the ...
