description: The gut microbiome affects the health status of the host through complex
  interactions with the host's intestinal wall. These host-microbiome interactions
  may spatially vary along the physical and chemical environment of the intestine,
  but these changes remain unknown. This study investigated these intricate relationships
  through a gene co-expression network analysis based on dual transcriptome profiling
  of different intestinal sites-cecum, transverse colon, and rectum-of the primate
