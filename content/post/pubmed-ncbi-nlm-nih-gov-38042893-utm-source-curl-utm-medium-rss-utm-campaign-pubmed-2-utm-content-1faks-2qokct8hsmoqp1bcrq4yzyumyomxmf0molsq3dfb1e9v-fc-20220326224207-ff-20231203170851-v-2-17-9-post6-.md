description: The implications of the existence of different actins expressed in epithelial
  cells for network mechanics and dynamics is investigated by microrheology and confocal
  imaging. γ-actin predominately found in the apical cortex forms stiffer networks
  compared to β-actin, which is preferentially organized in stress fibers. We attribute
  this to selective interactions with Mg^(2+)-ions interconnecting the filaments'
  N-termini. Bundling propensity of the isoforms is different in the presence ...
