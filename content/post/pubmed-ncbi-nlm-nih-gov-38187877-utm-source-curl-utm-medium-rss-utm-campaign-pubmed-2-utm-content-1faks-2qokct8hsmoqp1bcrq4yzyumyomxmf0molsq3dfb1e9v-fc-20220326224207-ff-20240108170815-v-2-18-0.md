description: Diffusion MRI has provided insight into the widespread structural connectivity
  changes that characterize epilepsies. Although syndrome-specific white matter abnormalities
  have been demonstrated, studies to date have predominantly relied on statistical
  comparisons between patient and control groups. For diffusion MRI techniques to
  be of clinical value, they should be able to detect white matter microstructural
  changes in individual patients. In this study, we apply an individualized approach
