description: The medicinal effect of a drug acts through a series of genes, and the
  pathological mechanism of a disease is also related to genes with certain biological
  functions. However, the complex information between drug or disease and a series
  of genes is neglected by traditional message passing methods. In this study, we
  proposed a new framework using two different strategies for gene-drug/disease and
  drug-disease networks, respectively. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM) network
  to extract ...
