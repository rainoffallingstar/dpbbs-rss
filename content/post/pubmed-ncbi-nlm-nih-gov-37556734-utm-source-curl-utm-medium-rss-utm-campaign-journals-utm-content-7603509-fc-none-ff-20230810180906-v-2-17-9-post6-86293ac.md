description: The early thymic precursor (ETP) immunophenotype was previously reported
  to confer poor outcome in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), requiring
  prospective confirmation using contemporary risk-adjusted therapy. Between 2009
  and 2014, 1,256 newly-diagnosed children and young adults enrolled on COG AALL0434
  were assessed for ETP status and minimal residual disease (MRD) using flow cytometry
  at a central reference laboratory. Subjects were categorized as ETP (n=145; 11.5%),
