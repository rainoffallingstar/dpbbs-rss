description: When performing an aggregate data meta-analysis of a continuous outcome,
  researchers often come across primary studies that report the sample median of the
  outcome. However, standard meta-analytic methods typically cannot be directly applied
  in this setting. In recent years, there has been substantial development in statistical
  methods to incorporate primary studies reporting sample medians in meta-analysis,
  yet there are currently no comprehensive software tools implementing these methods.
