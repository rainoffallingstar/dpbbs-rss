  acts as a stable surrogate of the elusive dication [B2(hpp)2]2+, being both electrophilic
  (vacant boron p orbitals) and nucleophilic (filled B-B bond orbital). This combination
  of seemingly contrasting behaviors could be used to develop a metallomimetic diborane
  chemistry, with Lewis σ-basic and π-acidic substrates being bound and reduced at
  the diborane. Here, we report on a novel reaction ...
