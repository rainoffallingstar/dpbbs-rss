description: FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), encoded by FLT3LG, is a
  hematopoietic factor essential for the development of natural killer (NK) cells,
  B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) in mice. We describe three humans homozygous
  for a loss-of-function FLT3LG variant with a history of various recurrent infections,
  including severe cutaneous warts. The patients' bone marrow (BM) was hypoplastic,
  with low levels of hematopoietic progenitors, particularly myeloid and B cell precursors.
