description: Chronic active Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) disease (CAEBV) is lethal syndrome
  due to persistent EBV infection. When diagnosed as CAEBV, EBV infection was observed
  in multiple hematopoietic lineages, but the etiology of CAEBV is still elusive.
  Bone marrow and peripheral cells derived from five CAEBV patients, one EBV-associated
  hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) patient, and two healthy controls were
