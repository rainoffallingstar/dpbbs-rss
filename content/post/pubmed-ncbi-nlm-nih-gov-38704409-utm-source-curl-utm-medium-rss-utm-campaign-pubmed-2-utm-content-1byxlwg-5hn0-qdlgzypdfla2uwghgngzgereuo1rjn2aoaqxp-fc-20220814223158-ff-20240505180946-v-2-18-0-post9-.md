description: Accurate intraoperative differentiation of primary central nervous system
  lymphoma (PCNSL) remains pivotal in guiding neurosurgical decisions. However, distinguishing
  PCNSL from other lesions, notably glioma, through frozen sections challenges pathologists.
  Here we sought to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of precisely
  distinguishing PCNSL from non-PCNSL lesions, especially glioma, using hematoxylin
  and eosin (H&E)-stained frozen whole-slide images. Also, we compared ...
