description: IGHV3-33-encoded antibodies are prevalent in the human humoral response
  against the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). Among VH3-33
  antibodies, cross-reactivity between PfCSP major repeat (NANP), minor (NVDP), and
  junctional (NPDP) motifs is associated with high affinity and potent parasite inhibition.
  However, the molecular basis of antibody cross-reactivity and the relationship with
  efficacy remain unresolved. Here, we perform an extensive structure-function...
