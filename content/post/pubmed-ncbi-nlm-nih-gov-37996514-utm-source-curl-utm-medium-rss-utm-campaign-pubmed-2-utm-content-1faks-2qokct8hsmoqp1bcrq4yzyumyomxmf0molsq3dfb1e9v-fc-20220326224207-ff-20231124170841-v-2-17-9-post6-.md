description: Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting myeloid cells that regulate
  T cell activation, trafficking and function. Monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with tumor
  antigens have been tested extensively for therapeutic vaccination in cancer, with
  mixed clinical results. Here, we present a cell-therapy platform based on mouse
  or human DC progenitors (DCPs) engineered to produce two immunostimulatory cytokines,
  IL-12 and FLT3L. Cytokine-armed DCPs differentiated into conventional type-I DCs
  (cDC1) ...
