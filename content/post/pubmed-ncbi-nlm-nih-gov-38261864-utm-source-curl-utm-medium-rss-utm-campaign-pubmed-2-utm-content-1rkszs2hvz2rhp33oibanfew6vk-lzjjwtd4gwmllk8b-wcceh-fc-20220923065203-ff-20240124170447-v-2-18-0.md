description: Rare preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (pHSC) harboring only the initiating
  mutations can be detected at the time of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) diagnosis.
  pHSCs are the origin of leukemia and a potential reservoir for relapse. Using primary
  human samples and gene editing to model isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutant
  pHSCs, we show epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic differences between pHSCs
  and healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). We confirm that IDH1-driven ...
