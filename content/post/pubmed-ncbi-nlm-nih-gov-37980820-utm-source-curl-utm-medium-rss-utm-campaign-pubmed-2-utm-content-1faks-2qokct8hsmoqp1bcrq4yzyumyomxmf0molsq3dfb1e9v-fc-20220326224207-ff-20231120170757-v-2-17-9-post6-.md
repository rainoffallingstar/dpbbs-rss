description: In this study, changes in salivary and serum proteome of dogs with hypothyroidism
  were studied using tandem mass tags (TMT) labelling and liquid chromatography-mass
  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Saliva and serum proteome from 10 dogs with hypothyroidism
  were compared with 10 healthy dogs. In saliva, a total of seven proteins showed
  significant changes between the two groups, being six downregulated and one upregulated,
  meanwhile, in serum, a total of six proteins showed significant changes, ...
