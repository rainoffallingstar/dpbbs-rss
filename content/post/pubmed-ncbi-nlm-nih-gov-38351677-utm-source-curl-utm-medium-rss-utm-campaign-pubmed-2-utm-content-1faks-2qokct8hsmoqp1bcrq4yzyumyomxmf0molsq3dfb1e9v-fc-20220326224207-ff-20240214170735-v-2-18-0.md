description: We describe a novel intramolecular double hydrofunctionalization cyclization
  of alkyne with nitrogen and oxygen nucleophilic groups to construct valuable 6/7/5-fused
  heterocyclic products. This post-Groebke-Blackburn-Bienaymé (GBB) reaction introduces
  a new class of functionalized isocyanides. Transition-metal-free cyclization, broad
  substrate scope, and high atom economy were some features of the present ...
