description: Wound healing is a complex process that requires the participation of
  multiple cells and cytokines. During the process of wound healing, abnormality in
  any stage of the process may lead to the development of a chronic refractory wound.
  Research has confirmed that various stem cells can promote wound healing, but some
  stem cells are limited in clinical application due to difficulties in isolation,
  susceptibility to apoptosis, ethical and legal issues. Oral mucosal stem cells (OMSCs)
  can avoid ...
