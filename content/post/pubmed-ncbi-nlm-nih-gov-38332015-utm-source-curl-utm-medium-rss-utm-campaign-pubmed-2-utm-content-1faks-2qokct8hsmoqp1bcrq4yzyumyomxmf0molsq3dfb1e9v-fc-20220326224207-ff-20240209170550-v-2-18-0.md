description: Patients with bipolar disorder (BD) show alterations in both gray matter
  volume (GMV) and white matter (WM) integrity compared with healthy controls (HC).
  However, it remains unclear whether the phenotypically distinct BD subtypes (BD-I
  and BD-II) also exhibit brain structural differences. This study investigated GMV
  and WM differences between HC, BD-I, and BD-II, along with clinical and genetic
  associations. N = 73 BD-I, n = 63 BD-II patients and n = 136 matched HC were included.
