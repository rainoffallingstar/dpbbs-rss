description: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is estimated to cause 13% of all antimicrobial
  resistance-attributable deaths worldwide and is driven by both ongoing resistance
  acquisition and person-to-person transmission. Poor outcomes are exacerbated by
  late diagnosis and inadequate access to effective treatment. Advances in rapid molecular
  testing have recently improved the diagnosis of TB and drug resistance. Next-generation
  sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has increased our understanding ...
