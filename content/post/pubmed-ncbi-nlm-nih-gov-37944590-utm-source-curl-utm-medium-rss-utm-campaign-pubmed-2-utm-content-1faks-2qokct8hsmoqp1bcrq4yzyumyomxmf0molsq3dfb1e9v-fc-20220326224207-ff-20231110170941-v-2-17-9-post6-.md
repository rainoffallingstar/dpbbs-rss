description: Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for meningioma, the most common
  primary intracranial tumor, but improvements in meningioma risk stratification are
  needed and indications for postoperative radiotherapy are controversial. Here we
  develop a targeted gene expression biomarker that predicts meningioma outcomes and
  radiotherapy responses. Using a discovery cohort of 173 meningiomas, we developed
  a 34-gene expression risk score and performed clinical and analytical validation
  of this biomarker ...
