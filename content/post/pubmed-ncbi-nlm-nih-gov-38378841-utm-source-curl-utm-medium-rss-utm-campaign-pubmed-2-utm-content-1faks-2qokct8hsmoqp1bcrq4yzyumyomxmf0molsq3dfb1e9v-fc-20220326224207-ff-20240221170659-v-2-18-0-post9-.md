description: Molecularly defined secondary acute myeloid leukemia is associated with
  a prior myeloid neoplasm and confers a worse prognosis. We compared outcomes of
  molecularly defined secondary AML patients (n = 395) treated with daunorubicin and
  cytarabine (7 + 3, n = 167), liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine (CPX-351, n =
  66) or hypomethylating agents (HMA) + venetoclax (VEN) (n = 162). Median overall
  survival (OS) was comparable between treatment groups among patients aged >60 years.
