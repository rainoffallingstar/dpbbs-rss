description: We disclose π-expanded pyracylenes and their cationic species comprising
  7-membered rings. The compounds were synthesized by stepwise oxidative cyclodehydrogenation
  to monitor the effect of successive cyclization on the structural and optoelectronic
  properties. As shown by X-ray crystallography the complete cyclization leads to
  a boat-shaped scaffold featuring negative curvature provided by the 7-membered ring.
  The embedded tropone unit enabled the convenient generation of a stabilized ...
