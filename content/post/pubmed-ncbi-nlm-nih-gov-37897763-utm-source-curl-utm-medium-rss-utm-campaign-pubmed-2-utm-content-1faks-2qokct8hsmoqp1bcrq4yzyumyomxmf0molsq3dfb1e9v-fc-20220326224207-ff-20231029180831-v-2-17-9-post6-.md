description: The diffuse Galactic γ-ray emission, mainly produced via interactions
  between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium and/or radiation field, is a very
  important probe of the distribution, propagation, and interaction of cosmic rays
  in the Milky Way. In this Letter, we report the measurements of diffuse γ rays from
  the Galactic plane between 10 TeV and 1 PeV energies, with the square kilometer
  array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Diffuse emissions
