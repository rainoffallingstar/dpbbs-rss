description: While field ionization (FI) and field desorption (FD) are established
  soft vacuum ionization methods in mass spectrometry (MS), the technique of atmospheric
  pressure field desorption (APFD) has only recently been added to the repertoire.
  Similar to FI and FD, APFD can yield both positive even-electron ions of highly
  polar or ionic compounds and positive molecular ions, M^(+•), e.g., of polycyclic
  aromatic compounds. Thus, a dedicated APFD source assembly has been constructed
  and demonstrated ...
