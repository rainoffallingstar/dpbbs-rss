description: Although CMML since long has been separated from MDS, many studies continue
  to evaluate the outcomes of both diseases after hematopoietic cell transplantation
  (allo-HCT) together. Data evaluating outcomes of a large CMML cohort after allo-HCT
  compared to MDS are limited. We aim to compare outcomes of CMML to MDS patients
  who underwent allo-HCT between 2010 and 2018. Patients ≥18 years with CMML and MDS
  undergoing allo-HCT reported to the EBMT registry were analyzed. Progression to
