description: 'PURPOSE: Sport climbing may lead to tissue adaptation including finger
  cartilage before apparent surface damage is detectable. The main aim was to assess
  finger cartilage composition with T2 mapping in young, active climbers and to compare
  the results to a non-climbers'' collective. A secondary aim was to compare whether
  differences in cartilage T2 times are observed between older vs. younger ...'
