description: The role of measurable residual disease (MRD) negativity as a biomarker
  to stop treatment is being investigated in transplant-eligible multiple myeloma
  (MM). Thus, it is important to identify risk factors of MRD resurgence and/or progressive
  disease (PD) among patients achieving undetectable MRD in order to avoid undertreating
  them. Here, we studied 267 newly-diagnosed transplant-eligible MM patients enrolled
  in the GEM2012MENOS65 and GEM2014MAIN clinical trials who achieved MRD negativity
