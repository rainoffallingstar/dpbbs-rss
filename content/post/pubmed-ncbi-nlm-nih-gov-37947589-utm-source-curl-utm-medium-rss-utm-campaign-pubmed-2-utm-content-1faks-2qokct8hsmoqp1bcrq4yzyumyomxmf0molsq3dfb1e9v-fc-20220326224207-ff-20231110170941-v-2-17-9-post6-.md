description: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the prevalent type of peripheral
  neuropathy; it primarily impacts extremity nerves. Its multifaceted nature makes
  the molecular mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy intricate and incompletely elucidated.
  Several types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been implicated in
  the development and progression of DPN, including phosphorylation, glycation, acetylation
  and SUMOylation. SUMOylation involves the covalent attachment of small ...
