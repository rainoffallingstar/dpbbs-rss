description: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a significant global health concern, requiring
  effective preclinical models for studying its development and testing therapies.
  Mouse models have been used, including spontaneous tumors, carcinogen exposure,
  and tumor cell implantation as xenografts or at orthotopic sites. Here, we describe
  an orthotopic preclinical model of CRC, which provides a valuable tool for studying
  tumor growth and the tumor microenvironment, offering a more accurate representation
