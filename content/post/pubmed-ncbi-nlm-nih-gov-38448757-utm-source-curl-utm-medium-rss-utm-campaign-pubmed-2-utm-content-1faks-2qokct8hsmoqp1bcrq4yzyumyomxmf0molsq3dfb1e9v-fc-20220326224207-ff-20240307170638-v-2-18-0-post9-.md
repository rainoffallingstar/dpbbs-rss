description: We identified 71 patients with AdvSM (aggressive SM [ASM], SM with an
  associated hematologic neoplasm [SM-AHN, e.g., acute myeloid leukemia, SM-AML],
  mast cell leukemia [MCL]) in two national registries (DRST/GREM) who received an
  allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) performed in Germany from
  1999-2021. Median overall survival (OS) of ASM/SM-AHN (n = 30, 45%), SM-AML (n =
  28, 39%) and MCL ± AHN (n = 13, 19%) was 9.0, 3.3 and 0.9 years (P = 0.007). Improved
  median OS ...
