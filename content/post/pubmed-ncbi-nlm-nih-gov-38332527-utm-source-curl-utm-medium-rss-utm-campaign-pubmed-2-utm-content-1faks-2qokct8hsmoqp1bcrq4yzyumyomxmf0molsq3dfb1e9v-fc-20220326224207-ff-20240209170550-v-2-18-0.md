description: For CNS lymphomas (CNSL), there is a high need for minimally invasive
  and easily obtainable diagnostic markers. Intrathecal IgM synthesis can easily be
  determined in routine CSF diagnostics. The aim of this study was to systematically
  investigate the diagnostic potential of intrathecal IgM synthesis in primary and
  secondary CNSL (PCNSL and SCNSL). In this retrospective study, patients with a biopsy-proven
  diagnosis of PCNSL or SCNSL were compared with patients with other neurological
  diseases ...
