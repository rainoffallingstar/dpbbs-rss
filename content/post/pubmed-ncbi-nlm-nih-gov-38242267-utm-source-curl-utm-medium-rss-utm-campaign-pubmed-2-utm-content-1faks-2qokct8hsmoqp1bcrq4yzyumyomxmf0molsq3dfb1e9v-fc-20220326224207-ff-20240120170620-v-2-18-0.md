description: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often culminates in hypercalcemia, instigating
  severe neurological injuries that are not yet fully understood. This study unveils
  a mechanism, where GSK343 ameliorates CKD-induced neural damage in mice by modulating
  macrophage polarization through the EZH2/MST1/YAP1 signaling axis. Specifically,
  GSK343 downregulated the expression of histone methyltransferase EZH2 and upregulated
  MST1, which suppressed YAP1, promoting M2 macrophage polarization and ...
