description: Sectionectomy is a parenchma-sparing alternative to (extended) right
  or left hemihepatectomy. However, the effectiveness and safety of robotic sectionectomy
  (RS) versus robotic (extended) hemihepatectomy (RH) for the treatment of liver tumors
  remains unclear. We reviewed our prospective database for consecutive patients who
  had undergone robotic hepatectomies between March 2021 and July 2023 and included
  all patients with RS and RH. Demographic data, perioperative outcomes and long-term
