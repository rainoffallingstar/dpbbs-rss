description: The review examines the vital role of prostate-specific membrane antigen
  (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in the diagnosis,
  staging, and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). It focuses on the superior diagnostic
  abilities of PSMA PET/CT for identifying both nodal and distant PCa, and its potential
  as a prognostic indicator for biochemical recurrence and overall survival. Additionally,
  we focused on the variability of PSMA's expression and its impact on ...
