description: S100A8 is a calcium-binding protein with multiple functions, including
  being a chemoattractant for phagocytes and playing a key role in the inflammatory
  response. Its expression has been shown to influence epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  (EMT) and metastasis in colorectal cancer. However, the role of S100A8 in cell proliferation
  and differentiation remains unknown. In this study, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system
  to knock out S100A8 in healthy mammary epithelial cells and investigated ...
