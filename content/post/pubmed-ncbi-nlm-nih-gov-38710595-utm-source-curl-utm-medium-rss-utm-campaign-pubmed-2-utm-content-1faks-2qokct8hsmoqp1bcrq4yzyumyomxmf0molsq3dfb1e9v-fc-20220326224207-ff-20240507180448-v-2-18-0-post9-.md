description: The treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has changed fundamentally
  in the last decade with many new targeted therapies entering clinics. Some of the
  most interesting agents under development are Menin inhibitors which interfere with
  the interaction of Menin with wild-type (wt) KMT2A or a KMT2A-fusion protein and
  thereby downregulate the leukaemic gene expression (MEIS1, PBX3, HOX) in NPM1 mutant
  or KMT2A-rearranged leukaemia. Other HOX and MEIS1 expressing leukaemias may also
  be ...
