description: Despite advances in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, acute
  graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains its leading complication, yet with heterogeneous
  outcomes. Here, we analyzed aGVHD phenotypes and clinical classifications in depth
  in large, multicenter cohorts involving 3019 patients and addressed prevailing gaps
  by developing data-driven models. We compared, tested and verified these along with
  all conventional classifications in independent cohorts and found that ...
