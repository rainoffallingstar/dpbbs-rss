description: Machine learning-based anomaly detection (AD) methods are promising tools
  for extending the coverage of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
  One class of AD methods that has received significant attention is resonant anomaly
  detection, where the BSM physics is assumed to be localized in at least one known
  variable. While there have been many methods proposed to identify such a BSM signal
  that make use of simulated or detected data in different ways, there has not yet
