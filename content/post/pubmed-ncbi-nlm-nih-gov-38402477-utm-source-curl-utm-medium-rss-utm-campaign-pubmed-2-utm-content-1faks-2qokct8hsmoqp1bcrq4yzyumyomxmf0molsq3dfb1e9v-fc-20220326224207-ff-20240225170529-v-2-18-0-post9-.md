description: All layers and appendages of the skin are densely innervated by afferent
  and efferent neurons providing sensory information and controlling skin perfusion
  and sweating. In mice, neuronal functions have been comprehensively linked to unique
  single-cell expression patterns and to characteristic arborization of nerve endings
  in skin and dorsal horn, whereas for humans, specific molecular markers for functional
  classes of afferent neurons are still lacking. Moreover, bidirectional ...
