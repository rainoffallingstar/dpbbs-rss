description: MicroRNAs are tissue-specific expressed short RNAs that serve post-transcriptional
  gene regulation. A specific microRNA can bind to mRNAs of different genes and thereby
  suppress their protein production. In the context of the complex phenotype of fibromyalgia,
  we used the Axiom miRNA Target Site Genotyping Array to search genome-wide for DNA
  variations in microRNA genes, their regulatory regions, and in the 3'UTR of protein-coding
  genes. To identify disease-relevant DNA polymorphisms, a ...
