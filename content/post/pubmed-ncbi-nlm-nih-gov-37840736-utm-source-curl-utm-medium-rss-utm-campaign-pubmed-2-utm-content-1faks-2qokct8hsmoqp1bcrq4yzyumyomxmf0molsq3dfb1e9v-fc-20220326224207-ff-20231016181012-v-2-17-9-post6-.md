description: Nitrososphaeria in the phylum Crenarchaeota, is a widespread archaeal
  class in the oceanic realm, playing an important role in the marine carbon and nitrogen
  cycle. Nitrososphaeria-derived membrane lipids, i.e., isoprenoid glycerol dialkyl
  glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), are commonly employed to reconstruct past water temperatures
  using the TetraEther indeX of 86 carbon atoms (TEX(86)). This index is of particular
  importance for the brackish Baltic Sea as to date it appears to be the ...
