description: Ferroptosis and apoptosis are key cell-death pathways implicated in several
  human diseases including cancer. Ferroptosis is driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation
  and currently has no characteristic biomarkers or gene signatures. Here a continuous
  phenotypic gradient between ferroptosis and apoptosis coupled to transcriptomic
  and metabolomic landscapes is established. The gradual ferroptosis-to-apoptosis
  transcriptomic landscape is used to generate a unique, unbiased ...
