description: We hypothesized that fit older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  treated with decitabine (DEC) would report better health-related quality of life
  (HRQoL) outcomes compared to those receiving intensive chemotherapy (IC). We conducted
  a phase 3 randomized trial to compare DEC (10-day schedule) to IC (3+7) in older
  fit AML patients. HRQoL was a secondary endpoint, and it was assessed with the EORTC
  QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-ELD14. The following scales were a priori selected for defining
