  for biomedical applications. The fluorinated fentanyl derivative N-(3-fluoro-1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-phenylpropionamide
  (NFEPP) is potentially a safer alternative to fentanyl because unlike fentanyl─which
  binds to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) at both physiological and acidic pH─NFEPP might
  bind to the MOR only at acidic pH typical of inflamed tissue. Knowledge of the protonation-coupled
