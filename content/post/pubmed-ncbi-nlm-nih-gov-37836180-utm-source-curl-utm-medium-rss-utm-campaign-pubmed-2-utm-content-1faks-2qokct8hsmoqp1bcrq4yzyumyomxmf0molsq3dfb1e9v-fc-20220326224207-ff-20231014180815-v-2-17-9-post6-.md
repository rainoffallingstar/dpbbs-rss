description: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are still
  a major problem in hospitals. The excellent safety profile, accessibility and anti-infective
  activity of tea extracts make them promising agents for the treatment of infected
  wounds. To investigate the possibility of sterilising MRSA-infected surfaces, including
