description: Gene regulation plays a critical role in the cellular processes that
  underlie human health and disease. The regulatory relationship between transcription
  factors (TFs), key regulators of gene expression, and their target genes, the so
  called TF regulons, can be coupled with computational algorithms to estimate the
  activity of TFs. However, to interpret these findings accurately, regulons of high
  reliability and coverage are needed. In this study, we present and evaluate a collection
