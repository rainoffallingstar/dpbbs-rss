description: Gene expression data can serve for analyzing the genes with changed expressions,
  the correlation between genes and the influence of different circumstance on gene
  activities. However, labeling a large number of gene expression data is laborious
  and time-consuming. The insufficient labeled data pose a challenge to construct
  the deep learning model. Currently, some graph neural networks (GNN) based on semi-supervised
  learning mechanism only focus on the feature space and sample space of ...
