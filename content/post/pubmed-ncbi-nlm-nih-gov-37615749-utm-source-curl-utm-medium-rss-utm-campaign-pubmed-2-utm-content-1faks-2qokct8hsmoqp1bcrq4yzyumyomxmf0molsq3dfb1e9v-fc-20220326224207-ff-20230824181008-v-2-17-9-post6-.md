description: Transient receptor potential cation channel-6 (TRPC6) gene mutations
  cause familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), which is inherited as
  an autosomal dominant disease. In patients with TRPC6-related FSGS, all mutations
  map to the N- or C-terminal TRPC6 protein domains. Thus far, the majority of TRPC6
  mutations are missense resulting in increased or decreased calcium influx; however,
  the fundamental molecular mechanisms causing cell injury and kidney pathology are
  unclear. We report ...
