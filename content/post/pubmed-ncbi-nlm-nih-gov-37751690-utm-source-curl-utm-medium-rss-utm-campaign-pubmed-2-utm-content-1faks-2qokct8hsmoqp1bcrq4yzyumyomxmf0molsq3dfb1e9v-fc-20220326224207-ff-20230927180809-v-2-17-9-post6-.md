description: Photoautotrophs' environmental responses have been extensively studied
  at the organism and ecosystem level. However, less is known about their photosynthesis
  at the single-cell level. This information is needed to understand photosynthetic
  acclimation processes, as light changes as it penetrates cells, layers of cells,
  or organs. Furthermore, cells within the same tissue may behave differently, being
  at different developmental/physiological stages. Here, we describe an approach for
