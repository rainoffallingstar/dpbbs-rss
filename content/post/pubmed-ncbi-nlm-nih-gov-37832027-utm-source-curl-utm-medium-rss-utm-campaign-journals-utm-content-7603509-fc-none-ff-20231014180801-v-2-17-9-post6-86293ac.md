description: The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum invades and replicates asexually
  within human erythrocytes. CD44 expressed on erythrocytes was previously identified
  as an important host factor for P. falciparum infection through a forward genetic
  screen, but little is known about its regulation or function in these cells, nor
  how it may be utilized by the parasite. We found that CD44 can be efficiently deleted
  from primary human hematopoietic stem cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, and
  that ...
