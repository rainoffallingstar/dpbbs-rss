description: Although previous studies investigated the influence of cardiovascular
  risk (CVR) factors in patients with acute coronary syndrome, data concerning the
  effect of CVR factors on the prognosis of patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) is
  scarce. Consecutive patients with CS were prospectively included from 2019 to 2021.
  The prognosis of patients with "low CVR" (i.e., 0-1 CVR factors) was compared to
  patients with "high CVR" (i.e., 2-4 CVR factors) according to presence or absence
  of ...
