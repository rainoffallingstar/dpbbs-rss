description: This study developed a new burn wound dressing based on core-shell nanofibers
  that co-deliver antibiotic and antioxidant drugs. For this purpose, poly(ethylene
  oxide) (PEO)-chitosan (CS)/poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) core-shell nanofibers
  were fabricated through co-axial electrospinning technique. Antibiotic levofloxacin
  (LEV) and antioxidant quercetin (QS) were incorporated into the core and shell parts
  of PEO-CS/PLGA nanofibers, respectively. The drugs could bond to the polymer ...
