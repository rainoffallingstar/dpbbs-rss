description: Factor X (FX)-deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder manifesting a bleeding
  tendency caused by low FX activity levels. We aimed to explore the use of fitusiran
  (an investigational siRNA that silences antithrombin expression) to increase thrombin
  generation and the in vivo hemostatic potential under conditions of FX-deficiency.
  We therefore developed a novel model of inducible FX-deficiency, generating mice
  expressing <1% FX activity and antigen (f10low-mice). Compared to control ...
