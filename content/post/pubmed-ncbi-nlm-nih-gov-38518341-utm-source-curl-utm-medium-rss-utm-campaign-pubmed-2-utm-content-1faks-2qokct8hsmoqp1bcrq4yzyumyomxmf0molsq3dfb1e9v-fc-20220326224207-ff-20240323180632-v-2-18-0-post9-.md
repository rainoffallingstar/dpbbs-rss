description: ATLAS measured the centrality dependence of the dijet yield using 165
  nb^{-1} of p+Pb data collected at sqrt[s_{NN}]=8.16 TeV in 2016. The event centrality,
  which reflects the p+Pb impact parameter, is characterized by the total transverse
  energy registered in the Pb-going side of the forward calorimeter. The central-to-peripheral
  ratio of the scaled dijet yields, R_{CP}, is evaluated, and the results are presented
  as a function of variables that reflect the kinematics of the initial hard ...
