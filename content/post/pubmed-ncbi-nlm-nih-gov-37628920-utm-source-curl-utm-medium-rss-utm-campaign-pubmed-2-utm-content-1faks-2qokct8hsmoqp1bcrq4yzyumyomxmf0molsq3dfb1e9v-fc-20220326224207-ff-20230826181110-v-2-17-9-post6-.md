description: The protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the causative pathogen
  of the most severe form of malaria, for which novel strategies for treatment are
  urgently required. The primary energy supply for intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium
  is the production of ATP via glycolysis. Due to the parasite's strong dependence
  on this pathway and the significant structural differences of its glycolytic enzymes
  compared to its human counterpart, glycolysis is considered a potential drug target.
