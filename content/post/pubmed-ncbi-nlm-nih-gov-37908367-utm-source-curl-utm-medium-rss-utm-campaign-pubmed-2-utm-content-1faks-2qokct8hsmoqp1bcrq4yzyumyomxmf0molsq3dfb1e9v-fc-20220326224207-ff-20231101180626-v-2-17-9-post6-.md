description: The Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)
  is a cutting-edge technology that enables researchers to assess genome-wide chromatin
  accessibility and to characterize cell type specific gene-regulatory programs. Recent
  technological progress allows for using this technology also on the single-cell
  level. In this article, we describe the whole value chain from the isolation of
  T cells from murine tissues to a complete bioinformatic analysis workflow. We start
