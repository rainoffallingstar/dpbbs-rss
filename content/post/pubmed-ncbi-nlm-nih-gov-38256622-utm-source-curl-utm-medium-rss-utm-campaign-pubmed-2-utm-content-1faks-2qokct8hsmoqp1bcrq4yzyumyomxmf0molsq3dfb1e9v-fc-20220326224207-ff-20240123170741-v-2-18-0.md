description: Limited data concerning the diagnostic and prognostic value of blood-derived
  biomarkers in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) is available.
  This study investigates the diagnostic and prognostic value of aminoterminal prohormone
  of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with HFmrEF, stratified by
  the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Consecutive patients with HFmrEF
  were retrospectively included at one institution from 2016 to 2022. First, ...
