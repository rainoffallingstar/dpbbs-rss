description: Inorganic pyrophosphate is a key molecule in many biological processes
  from DNA synthesis to cell metabolism. Here we introduce sp³-functionalized (6,5)
  single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with red-shifted defect emission as near-infrared
  luminescent probes for the optical detection and quantification of inorganic pyrophosphate.
  The sensing scheme is based on the immobilization of Cu^(2+) ions on the SWNT surface
  promoted by coordination to covalently attached aryl alkyne groups and ...
