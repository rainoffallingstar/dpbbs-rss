description: Neurotoxic compounds can interfere with active gill ventilation in fish,
  which might lead to premature death in adult fish, but not in skin-breathing embryos
  of zebrafish, since these exclusively rely on passive diffusion across the skin.
  Regarding lethality, this respiratory failure syndrome (RFS) has been discussed
  as one of the main reasons for the higher sensitivity of adult fish in the acute
  fish toxicity test (AFT), if compared to embryos in the fish embryo toxicity test
  (FET). To ...
