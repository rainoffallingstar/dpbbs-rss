description: Elevated expression of c-MYC and inactivation of p53 represent two of
  the most common alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, c-MYC and defective
  p53 are difficult to target therapeutically. Therefore, effectors downstream of
  both c-MYC and p53 may represent attractive, alternative targets for cancer treatment.
  In a bioinformatics screen we identified Squalene epoxidase/SQLE as a candidate
  therapeutic target that appeared to be especially relevant for cell survival in
  CRCs, ...
