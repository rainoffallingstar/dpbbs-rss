description: Viruses infecting bacteria (bacteriophages) represent the most abundant
  viral particles in the human body. They participate in the control of the human-associated
  bacterial communities and play an important role in the dissemination of virulence
  genes. Here, we present the identification of a new filamentous single-stranded
  DNA phage of the family Inoviridae, named Ralstonia Inoviridae Phage 1 (RIP1), in
  the human blood. Metagenomics and PCR analyses detected the RIP1 genome in blood
  serum, ...
