description: Obinutuzumab (O) and Rituximab (R) are two CD antibodies that have never
  been compared in a prospective randomised trial in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Herein,
  we report the long-term outcome of the LYMA-101 (NCT02896582) trial, in which newly
  diagnosed MCL patients were treated with chemotherapy plus O before transplantation
  followed by O maintenance (O group). We then compared these patients to those treated
  with the same treatment design with Rituximab instead of O (R group) (NCT00921414).
