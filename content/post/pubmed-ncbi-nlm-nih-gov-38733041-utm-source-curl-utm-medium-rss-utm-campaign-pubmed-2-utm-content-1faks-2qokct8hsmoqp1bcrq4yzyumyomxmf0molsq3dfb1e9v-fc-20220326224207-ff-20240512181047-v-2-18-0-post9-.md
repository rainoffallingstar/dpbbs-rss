description: Open Hardware-based microcontrollers, especially the Arduino platform,
  have become a comparably easy-to-use tool for rapid prototyping and implementing
  creative solutions. Such devices in combination with dedicated front-end electronics
  can offer low-cost alternatives for student projects, slow control and independently
  operating small-scale instrumentation. The capabilities can be extended to data
  taking and signal analysis at mid-level rates. Two detector realizations are presented,
