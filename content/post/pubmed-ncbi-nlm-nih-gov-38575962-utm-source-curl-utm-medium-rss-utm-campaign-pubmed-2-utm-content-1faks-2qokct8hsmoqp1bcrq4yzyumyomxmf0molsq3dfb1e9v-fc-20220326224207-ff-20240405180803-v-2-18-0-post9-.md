description: 'CONCLUSION: The consumption of plant-based food groups, including nuts
  and whole grains, and diet quality, were associated with lower FLI values, whereas
  the intake of soft drinks and products of animal origin (meat, fish, eggs) were
  associated with a higher FLI. The observed statistically significant interactions
  with the metabotype for most food groups could help to develop targeted prevention
  strategies on a population-based level if confirmed in independent prospective ...'
