description: The N400, a negative event-related potential (ERP) peaking approximately
  400 ms after stimulus onset, is known to reflect the processing of semantic information.
  While scalp recordings have contributed to understanding the psychological processes
  underlying the N400, they have been limited in identifying its neural basis. However,
  recent intracranial ERP recordings and fMRI studies have shed light on the crucial
  role of the anterior medial temporal lobe (AMTL) in semantic information ...
