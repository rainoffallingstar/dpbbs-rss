description: Oxytocin is a neuropeptide associated with both psychological and somatic
  processes like parturition and social bonding. Although oxytocin homologs have been
  identified in many species, the evolutionary timeline of the entire oxytocin signaling
  gene pathway has yet to be described. Using protein sequence similarity searches,
  microsynteny, and phylostratigraphy, we assigned the genes supporting the oxytocin
  pathway to different phylostrata based on when we found they likely arose in evolution.
