description: Metabolic tumor volume (MTV) assessed using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose
  positron emission tomography, a measure of tumor burden, is a promising prognostic
  indicator in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). This exploratory analysis evaluated relationships
  between baseline MTV (categorized as low [≤median] vs high [>median]) and clinical
  outcomes in the phase 3 ZUMA-7 study (NCT03391466). Patients with LBCL relapsed
  within 12 months of or refractory to first-line chemoimmunotherapy were ...
