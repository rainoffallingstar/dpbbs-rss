description: Upon intramuscular entry, fatty acids are converted to amphiphatic fatty
  acyl-CoAs by action of the acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) enzymes. While it has been
  reported that insulin resistant skeletal muscle shows an accumulation of fatty acyl-CoAs,
  the role of the enzymes which catalyze their synthesis is still sparsely studied
  in human muscle, in particular the influence of obesity, and insulin resistance.
