description: Pelomyxa is a genus of anaerobic amoebae that live in consortia with
  multiple prokaryotic endosymbionts. Although the symbionts represent a large fraction
  of the cellular biomass, their metabolic roles have not been investigated. Using
  single-cell genomics and transcriptomics, we have characterized the prokaryotic
  community associated with P. schiedti, which is composed of two bacteria, Candidatus
  Syntrophus pelomyxae (class Deltaproteobacteria) and Candidatus Vesiculincola pelomyxae
