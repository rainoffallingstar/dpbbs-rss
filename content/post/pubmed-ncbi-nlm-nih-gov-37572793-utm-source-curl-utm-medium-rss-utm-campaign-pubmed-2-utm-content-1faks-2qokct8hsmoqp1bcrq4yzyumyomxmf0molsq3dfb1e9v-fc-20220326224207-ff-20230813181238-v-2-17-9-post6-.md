description: The fermentation process of milk to yoghurt using Lactobacillus delbrueckii
  subsp. bulgaricus in co-culture with Streptococcus thermophilus is hallmarked by
  the breakdown of lactose to organic acids such as lactate. This leads to a substantial
  decrease in pH - both in the medium, as well as cytosolic. The latter impairs metabolic
  activities due to the pH-dependence of enzymes, which compromises microbial growth.
  To quantitatively elucidate the impact of the acidification on metabolism of ...
