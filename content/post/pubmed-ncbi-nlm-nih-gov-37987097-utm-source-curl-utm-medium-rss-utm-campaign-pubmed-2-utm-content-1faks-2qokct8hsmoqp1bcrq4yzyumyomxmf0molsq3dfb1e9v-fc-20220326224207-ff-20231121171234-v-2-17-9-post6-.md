description: Macrocyclic and medium-sized ring ketones, lactones and lactams can all
  be made from common acryloyl imide starting materials via divergent, one-pot cascade
  ring expansion reactions. Following either conjugate addition with an amine or nitromethane,
  or osmium(VIII) catalysed dihydoxylation, rearrangement via a 4-atom ring expansion
  takes place spontaneously to form the ring expanded products. A second ring expansion
  can also be performed following a second iteration of imide formation and ...
