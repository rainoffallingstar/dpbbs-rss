description: Membrane-bound heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) apart from its intracellular
  localization was shown to be specifically expressed on the plasma membrane surface
  of tumor but not normal cells. Although the association of Hsp70 with lipid membranes
  is well documented the exact mechanisms for chaperone membrane anchoring have not
  been fully elucidated. Herein, we addressed the question of how Hsp70 interacts
  with negatively charged phospholipids in artificial lipid compositions employing
