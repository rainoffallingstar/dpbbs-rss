description: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important players in melanoma progression,
  but their use as clinical biomarkers has been limited by the difficulty of profiling
  blood-derived EV proteins with high depth of coverage, the requirement for large
  input amounts, and complex protocols. Here, we provide a streamlined and reproducible
  experimental workflow to identify plasma- and serum- derived EV proteins of healthy
  donors and melanoma patients using minimal amounts of sample input. SEC-DIA-MS ...
