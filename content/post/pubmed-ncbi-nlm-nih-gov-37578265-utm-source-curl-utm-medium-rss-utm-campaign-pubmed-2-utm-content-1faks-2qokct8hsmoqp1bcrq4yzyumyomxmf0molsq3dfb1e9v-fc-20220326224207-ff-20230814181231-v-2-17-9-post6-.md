description: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal neoplasms, believed
  to originate from the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), often caused by overexpression
  of tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR) KIT or PDGFRA. Here, we present evidence that
  the embryonic stem cell factor FOXD3, first identified as "Genesis" and functioning
  in both gastrointestinal and neural crest cell development, is implicated in GIST
  pathogenesis; its involvement is investigated both in vitro and in zebrafish and
