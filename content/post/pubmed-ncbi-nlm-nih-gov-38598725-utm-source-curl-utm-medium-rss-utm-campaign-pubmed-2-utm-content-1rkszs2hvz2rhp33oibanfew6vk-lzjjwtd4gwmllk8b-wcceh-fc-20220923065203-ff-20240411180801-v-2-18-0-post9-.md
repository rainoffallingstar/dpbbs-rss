description: The t(1;19) translocation, which codes for the oncogenic fusion protein
  E2A (TCF3)-PBX1, is involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and associated
  with a pre-B cell receptor (preBCR+) phenotype. Relapse in E2A-PBX1+ ALL patients
  frequently occurs in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, there is a medical
  need for the identification of CNS active regimens for the treatment of E2A-PBX1+/preBCR+
  ALL. Using unbiased shRNA library screening approaches, we identified Bruton's ...
