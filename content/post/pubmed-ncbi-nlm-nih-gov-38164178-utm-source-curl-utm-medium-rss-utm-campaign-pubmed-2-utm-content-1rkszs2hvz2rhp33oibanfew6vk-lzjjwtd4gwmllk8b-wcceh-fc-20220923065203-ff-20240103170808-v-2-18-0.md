description: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a malignant clonal disease involving
  hematopoietic stem cells that is characterized by myeloid cell proliferation in
  bone marrow and peripheral blood, and the presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome
  with BCR-ABL fusion gene. Treatment of CML has dramatically improved since the advent
  of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). However, there are a small subset of CML patients
  who develop resistance to TKI. Mutations in the ABL kinase domain (KD) are ...
