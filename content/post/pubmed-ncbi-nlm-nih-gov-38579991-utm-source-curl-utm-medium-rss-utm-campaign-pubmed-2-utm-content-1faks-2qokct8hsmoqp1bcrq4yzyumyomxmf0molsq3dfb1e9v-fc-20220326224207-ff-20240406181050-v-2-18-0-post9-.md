description: Myocardial failure is associated with adverse remodeling which includes
  apoptotic loss of cardiomyocytes, hypertrophy as well as alterations in cell-cell
  contacts. Striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complexes and their
  kinase Mst4 have been linked to the development of different diseases. The role
  and targets of Mst4 in cardiomyocytes have not been investigated, yet. Multi tissue
  immunoblot experiments show highly enriched Mst4-expression in rodent hearts. Analyses
