description: 'CONCLUSIONS: The analyzed literature describes a variety of materials
  from different origins to limit peripheral nerve scarring and adhesions. Thus, a
  scar-preventive effect by wrapping peripheral nerves as adhesion prophylaxis seems
  likely. However, a quantitative comparison of the studies to identify the optimal
  material or technique is not possible with the diversity of used models and study
  designs. Therefore, further research needs to be performed to identify the optimal
