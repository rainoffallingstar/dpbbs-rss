description: Despite the considerable efficacy observed when targeting a dispensable
  lineage antigen, such as CD19 in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia^(1,2), the
  broader applicability of adoptive immunotherapies is hampered by the absence of
  tumour-restricted antigens^(3-5). Acute myeloid leukaemia immunotherapies target
  genes expressed by haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) or differentiated
  myeloid cells, resulting in intolerable on-target/off-tumour toxicity. Here we show
