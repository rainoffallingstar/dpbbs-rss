description: Biological augmentation of bony defects in weight-bearing areas of both
  the acetabulum and the femur remains challenging. The calcium-silicate-based ceramic
  Baghdadite is a very interesting material to be used in the field of revision total
  hip arthroplasty for the treatment of bony defects in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing
  areas alike. The aim of this study was to investigate the biocompatibility of Baghdadite
  utilizing an osteoblast-like, human osteosarcoma cell line (MG-63) and ...
