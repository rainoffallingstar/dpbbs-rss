description: HELLS/LSH (Helicase, Lymphoid Specific) is a SNF2-like chromatin remodelling
  protein involved in DNA methylation. Its loss-of-function in humans causes humoral
  immunodeficiency, called ICF4 syndrome (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Instability,
  Facial anomalies). Here we show by our newly generated B-cell-specific Hells conditional
  knockout mouse model that HELLS plays a pivotal role in T-dependent B-cell responses.
