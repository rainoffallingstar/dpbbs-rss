description: Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) fusions are oncogenic drivers that have been detected
  in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and
  other solid tumors. NRG1 fusions are rare, occurring in less than 1% of solid tumors.
  Patients with NRG1 fusion positive (NRG1+) cancer have limited therapeutic options.
  Zenocutuzumab is a novel, bispecific IgG1 antibody that targets both HER2 and HER3
  proteins and inhibits NRG1 binding through a 'Dock & Block^(®)' mechanism of action.
