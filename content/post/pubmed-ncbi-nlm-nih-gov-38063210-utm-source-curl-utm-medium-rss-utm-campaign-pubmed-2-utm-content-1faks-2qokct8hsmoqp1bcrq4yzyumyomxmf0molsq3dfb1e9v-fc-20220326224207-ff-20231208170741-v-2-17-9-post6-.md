description: Blood is the most commonly used body fluid for extracellular vesicle
  (EV) research. The composition of a blood sample and its derivatives (i.e., plasma
  and serum) are not only donor-dependent but also influenced by collection and preparation
  protocols. Since there are hundreds of pre-analytical protocols and over forty variables,
  the development of standard operating procedures for EV research is very challenging.
  To improve the reproducibility of blood EV research, the International Society ...
