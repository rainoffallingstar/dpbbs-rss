description: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a poor prognosis and a heterogeneous
  mutation landscape. Although common mutations are well-studied, little research
  has characterized how the sequence of mutations relates to clinical features. Using
  published, single-cell DNA sequencing data from three institutions, we compared
  clonal evolution patterns in AML to patient characteristics, disease phenotype,
  and outcomes. Mutation trees, which represent the order of select mutations, were
