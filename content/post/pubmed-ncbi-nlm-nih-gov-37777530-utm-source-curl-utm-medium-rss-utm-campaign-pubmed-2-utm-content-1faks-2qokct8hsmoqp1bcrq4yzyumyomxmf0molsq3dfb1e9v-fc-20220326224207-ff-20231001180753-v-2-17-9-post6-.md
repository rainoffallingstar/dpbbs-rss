description: Molecular screens comparing different disease states to identify candidate
  genes rely on the availability of fast, reliable and multiplexable systems to interrogate
  genes of interest. CRISPR/Cas9-based reverse genetics is a promising method to eventually
  achieve this. However, such methods are sorely lacking for multi-nucleated muscle
  fibers, since highly efficient nuclei editing is a requisite to robustly inactive
  candidate genes. Here, we couple Cre-mediated skeletal muscle fiber-specific ...
