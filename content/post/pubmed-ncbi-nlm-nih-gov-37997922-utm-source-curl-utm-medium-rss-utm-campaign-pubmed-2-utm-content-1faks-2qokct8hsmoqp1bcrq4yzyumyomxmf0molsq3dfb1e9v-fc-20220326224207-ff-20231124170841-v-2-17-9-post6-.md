description: The correct inheritance of chromatin structure is key for maintaining
  genome function and cell identity and preventing cellular transformation. DEK, a
  conserved non-histone chromatin protein, has recognized tumor-promoting properties,
  its overexpression being associated with poor prognosis in various cancer types.
  At the cellular level, DEK displays pleiotropic functions, influencing differentiation,
  apoptosis, and stemness, but a characteristic oncogenic mechanism has remained elusive.
