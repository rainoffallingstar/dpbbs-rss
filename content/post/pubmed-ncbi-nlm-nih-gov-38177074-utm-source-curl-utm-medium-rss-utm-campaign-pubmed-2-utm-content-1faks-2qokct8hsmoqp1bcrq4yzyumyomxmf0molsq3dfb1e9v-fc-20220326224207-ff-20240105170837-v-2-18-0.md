description: Alterations of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling pathway
  are increasingly recognized as frequent oncogenic drivers of paediatric brain tumours.
  We report on three patients treated with the selective FGFR1-4 inhibitor erdafitinib.
  Two patients were diagnosed with a posterior fossa ependymoma group A (PFA EPN)
  and one with a low-grade glioma (LGG), harbouring FGFR3/FGFR1 overexpression and
  an FGFR1 internal tandem duplication (ITD), respectively. While both EPN patients
