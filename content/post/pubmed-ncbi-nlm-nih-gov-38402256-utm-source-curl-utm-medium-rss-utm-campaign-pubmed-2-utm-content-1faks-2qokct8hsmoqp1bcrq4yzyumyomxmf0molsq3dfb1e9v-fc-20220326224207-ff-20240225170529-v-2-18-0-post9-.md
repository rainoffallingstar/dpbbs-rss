description: The human papillomavirus minor capsid protein L2 is being extensively
  explored in pre-clinical studies as an attractive vaccine antigen capable of inducing
  broad-spectrum prophylactic antibody responses. Recently, we have developed two
  HPV vaccine antigens - PANHPVAX and CUT-PANHPVAX- both based on heptameric nanoparticle
  antigens displaying polytopes of the L2 major cross-neutralizing epitopes of eight
  mucosal and twelve cutaneous HPV types, respectively. Prompted by the variable ...
