description: Drug combination therapy has gradually become a promising treatment strategy
  for complex or co-existing diseases. As drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may cause
  unexpected adverse drug reactions, DDI prediction is an important task in pharmacology
  and clinical applications. Recently, researchers have proposed several deep learning
  methods to predict DDIs. However, these methods mainly exploit the chemical or biological
  features of drugs, which is insufficient and limits the performances of ...
