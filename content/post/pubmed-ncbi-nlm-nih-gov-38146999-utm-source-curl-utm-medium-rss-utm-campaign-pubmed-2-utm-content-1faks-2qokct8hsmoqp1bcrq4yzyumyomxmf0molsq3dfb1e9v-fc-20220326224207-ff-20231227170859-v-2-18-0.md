description: Within the last few decades, we have witnessed tremendous advancements
  in the study of pediatric low-grade gliomas (pLGG), leading to a much-improved understanding
  of their molecular underpinnings. Consequently, we have achieved successful milestones
  in developing and implementing targeted therapeutic agents for treating these tumors.
  However, the community continues to face many unknowns when it comes to the most
  effective clinical implementation of these novel targeted inhibitors ...
