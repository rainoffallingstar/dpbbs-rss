description: Cell culture scale-up is a challenging task due to the simultaneous change
  of multiple hydrodynamic process characteristics and their different dependencies
  on the bioreactor size as well as variation in the requirements of individual cell
  lines. Conventionally, the volumetric power input is the most common parameter to
  select the impeller speed for scale-up, however, it is well reported that this approach
  fails when there are huge differences in bioreactor scales. In this study, ...
