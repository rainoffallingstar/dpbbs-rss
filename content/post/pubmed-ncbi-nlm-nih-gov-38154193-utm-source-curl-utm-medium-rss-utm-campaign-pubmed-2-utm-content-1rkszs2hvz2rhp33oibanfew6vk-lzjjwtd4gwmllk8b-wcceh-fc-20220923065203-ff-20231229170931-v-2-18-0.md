description: Myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are clonal disorders of bone marrow failure
  exhibiting a variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. MDS exhibit
  certain prognostic genetic or cytogenetic abnormalities, an observation that has
  led to both the pathologic reclassification of MDS in the 2022 World Health Organization
  (WHO) and International Consensus Classification (ICC) systems, as well as to an
  updated prognostic schema, the Molecular International Prognostic Scoring System
