description: The leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6)
  was recently identified as the cognate receptor for the pro-resolving mediator Maresin
  (MaR)1. To address the biological role of LGR6 in humans, we investigated the functional
  impact of a genetic variant in the gene encoding for LGR6, which is predicted to
  lead to a frameshift mutation in one of the receptor isoforms, on both receptor
  expression and immune cell responses. In neutrophils, monocytes, and NK cells ...
