  the forward and backward rapidity regions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon
  pair of sqrt[s_{NN}]=8.16 TeV is measured by the LHCb experiment. The nuclear modification
  factor of prompt D^{0} mesons is determined as a function of the transverse momentum
  p_{T}, and the rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass frame y^{*}. In the
  forward rapidity region, significantly suppressed production with respect to ...
