description: The BrainScaleS-2 system is an established analog neuromorphic platform
  with versatile applications in the diverse fields of computational neuroscience
  and spike-based machine learning. In this work, we extend the system with a configurable
  realtime event interface that enables a tight coupling of its distinct analog network
  core to external sensors and actuators. The 1,000-fold acceleration of the emulated
  nerve cells allows us to target high-speed robotic applications that require ...
