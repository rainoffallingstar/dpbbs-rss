description: Timely diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis (SM) remains challenging due
  to care heterogeneity. We implemented a standardized approach for SM screening and
  diagnosis utilizing a novel healthcare system-wide international screening registry.
  A retrospective analysis assessed rates of SM, cutaneous mastocytosis (CM), and
  molecular diagnoses before and two years after care standardization. Accuracy of
  individual and combined SM screening tests - basal serum tryptase (BST) ≥11.5 and
  ≥20.0 ng/mL, ...
