description: A tissue sample is a valuable resource for understanding a patient's
  symptoms and health status in relation to tumor growth. Recent research seeks to
  establish a connection between tissue-specific tumor samples and genetic markers
  (genes). This breakthrough has paved the way for personalized cancer therapies.
  With this motivation, the proposed model constructs a heterogeneous network based
  on tumor sample-gene relation data and gene-gene interaction data. This network
