description: Increased eosinophil counts are associated with cardiovascular disease
  and may be an independent predictor of major cardiovascular events. However, the
  causality and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. GWAS have shown an association
  of a common LNK variant (R262W, T allele) with eosinophilia and atherothrombotic
  disorders. LNK(TT) reduces LNK function and Lnk-deficient mice display accelerated
  atherosclerosis and thrombosis. This study was undertaken to assess the role of
