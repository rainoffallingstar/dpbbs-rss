description: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was assumed that SARS-CoV-2
  could be transmitted through surgical smoke generated by electrocauterization. Minimally
  invasive surgery (MIS) was targeted due to potentially higher concentrations of
  the SARS-CoV-2 particles in the pneumoperitoneum. Some surgical societies even recommended
  open surgery instead of MIS to prevent the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the
  pneumoperitoneum. This study aimed to detect SARS-CoV-2 in surgical smoke ...
