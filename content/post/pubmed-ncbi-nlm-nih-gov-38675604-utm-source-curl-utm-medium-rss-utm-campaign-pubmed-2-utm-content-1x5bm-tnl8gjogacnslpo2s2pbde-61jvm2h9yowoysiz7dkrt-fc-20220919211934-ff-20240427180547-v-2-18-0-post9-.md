description: Detecting the unintended adverse reactions of drugs (ADRs) is a crucial
  concern in pharmacological research. The experimental validation of drug-ADR associations
  often entails expensive and time-consuming investigations. Thus, a computational
  model to predict ADRs from known associations is essential for enhanced efficiency
  and cost-effectiveness. Here, we propose BiMPADR, a novel model that integrates
  drug gene expression into adverse reaction features using a message passing neural
