description: Although systolic function characteristically shows gradual impairment
  in pressure overload (PO)-evoked left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH), rapid
  progression to congestive heart failure (HF) occurs in distinct cases. The molecular
  mechanisms for the differences in maladaptation are unknown. Here, we examined microRNA
  (miRNA) expression and miRNA-driven posttranscriptional gene regulation in the two
  forms of PO-induced LVH (with/without systolic HF). PO was induced by aortic banding
  (AB) ...
