description: The spatial distribution of lymphocyte clones within tissues is critical
  to their development, selection, and expansion. We have developed spatial transcriptomics
  of variable, diversity, and joining (VDJ) sequences (Spatial VDJ), a method that
  maps B cell and T cell receptor sequences in human tissue sections. Spatial VDJ
  captures lymphocyte clones that match canonical B and T cell distributions and amplifies
  clonal sequences confirmed by orthogonal methods. We found spatial congruency ...
