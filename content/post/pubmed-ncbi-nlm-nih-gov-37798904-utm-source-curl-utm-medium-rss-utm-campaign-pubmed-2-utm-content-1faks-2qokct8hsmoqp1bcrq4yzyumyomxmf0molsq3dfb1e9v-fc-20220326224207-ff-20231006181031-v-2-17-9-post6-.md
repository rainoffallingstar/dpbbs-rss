description: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive soft
  tissue sarcomas with a poor survival rate, presenting either sporadically or in
  the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The histological diagnosis of MPNSTs
  can be challenging, with different tumors exhibiting great histological and marker
  expression overlap. This heterogeneity could be partly responsible for the observed
  disparity in treatment response due to the inherent diversity of the preclinical
  models used. ...
