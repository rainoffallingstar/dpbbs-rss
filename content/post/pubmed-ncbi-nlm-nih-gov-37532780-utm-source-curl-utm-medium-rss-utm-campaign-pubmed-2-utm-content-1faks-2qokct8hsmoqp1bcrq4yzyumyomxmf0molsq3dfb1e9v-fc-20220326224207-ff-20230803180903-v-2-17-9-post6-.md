description: Tryptophan breakdown metabolites formed along the kynurenine pathway
  play a significant role in pregnancy and fetal development. To understand their
  involvement, it is crucial to quantify the levels of tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine
  (KYN), and kynurenic acid (KYNA) in relevant biological samples such as the placenta,
  fetal membranes, and umbilical cord. This study used liquid chromatography-tandem
  mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to determine TRP, KYN, and KYNA levels. The LC-MS/MS
  method ...
