description: '(1) Background: In elderly patients with type II odontoid fractures,
  accompanying severe atlantoaxial instability (AAI) is discussed as a marker possibly
  warranting more aggressive surgical therapy. This study aimed to characterize adverse
  events as well as the radiological and functional outcomes of surgical vs. conservative
  therapy in patients with odontoid fracture and AAI. (2) Methods: Patients aged 65
  years and older with type II odontoid fracture and AAI treated were included. AAI
