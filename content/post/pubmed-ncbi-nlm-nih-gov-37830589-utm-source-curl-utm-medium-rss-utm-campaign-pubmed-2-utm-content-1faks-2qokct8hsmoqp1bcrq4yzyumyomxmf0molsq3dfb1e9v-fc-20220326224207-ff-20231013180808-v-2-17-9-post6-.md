description: '(1) Background: Stereological estimations significantly contributed
  to our understanding of lung anatomy and physiology. Taking stereology fully 3-dimensional
  facilitates the estimation of novel parameters. (2) Methods: We developed a protocol
  for the analysis of all airspaces of an entire lung. It includes (i) high-resolution
  synchrotron radiation-based X-ray tomographic microscopy, (ii) image segmentation
  using the free machine-learning tool Ilastik and ImageJ, and (iii) calculation of
