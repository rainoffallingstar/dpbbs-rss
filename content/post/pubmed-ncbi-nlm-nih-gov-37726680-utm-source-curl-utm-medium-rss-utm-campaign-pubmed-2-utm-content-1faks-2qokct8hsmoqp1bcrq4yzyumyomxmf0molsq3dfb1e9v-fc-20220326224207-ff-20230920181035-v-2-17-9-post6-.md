description: Random Forests are a powerful and frequently applied Machine Learning
  tool. The permutation variable importance (VIMP) has been proposed to improve the
  explainability of such a pure prediction model. It describes the expected increase
  in prediction error after randomly permuting a variable and disturbing its association
  with the outcome. However, VIMPs measure a variable's marginal influence only, that
  can make its interpretation difficult or even misleading. In the present work we
