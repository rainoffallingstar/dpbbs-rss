description: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition caused
  by germline mutations in the NF1 gene. Children with NF1 are prone to the development
  of multiple nervous system abnormalities, including autism and brain tumors, which
  could reflect the effect of NF1 mutation on microglia function. Using heterozygous
  Nf1-mutant mice, we previously demonstrated that impaired purinergic signaling underlies
  deficits in microglia process extension and phagocytosis in situ. To determine ...
