description: Therapy-resistant leukemia stem and progenitor cells (LSC) are a main
  cause of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse. LSC-targeting therapies may thus
  improve outcome of patients with AML. Here we demonstrate that LSCs present HLA-restricted
  antigens that induce T-cell responses allowing for immune surveillance of AML. Using
  a mass spectrometry-based immunopeptidomics approach, we characterized the antigenic
  landscape of patient LSCs and identified AML- and AML/LSC-associated ...
