description: H3K27M, a driver mutation with T and B cell neoepitope characteristics,
  defines an aggressive subtype of diffuse glioma with poor survival. We functionally
  dissect the immune response of one patient treated with an H3K27M peptide vaccine
  who subsequently entered complete remission. The vaccine robustly expanded class
  II human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted peripheral H3K27M-specific T cells.
  Using functional assays, we characterized 34 clonally unique H3K27M-reactive T cell
  receptors ...
