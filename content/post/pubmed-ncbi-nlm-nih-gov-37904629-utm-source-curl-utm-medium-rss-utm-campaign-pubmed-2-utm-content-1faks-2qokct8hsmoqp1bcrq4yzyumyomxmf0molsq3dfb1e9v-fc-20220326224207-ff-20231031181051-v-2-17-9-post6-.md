description: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart disease characterized by left
  ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction. In 30% of cases, pathogenic variants,
  essentially private to each patient, are identified in at least one of almost 50
  reported genes. Thus, while costly, exons capture-based Next Generation Sequencing
  (NGS) of a targeted gene panel appears as the best strategy to genetically diagnose
  DCM. Here, we report a NGS strategy applied to pools of 8 DNAs from DCM patients
  and ...
