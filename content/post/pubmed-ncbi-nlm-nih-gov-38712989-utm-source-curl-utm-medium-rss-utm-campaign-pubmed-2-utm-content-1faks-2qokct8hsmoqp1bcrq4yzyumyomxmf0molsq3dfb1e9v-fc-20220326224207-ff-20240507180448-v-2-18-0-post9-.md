description: C-terminal truncated variants (A, VA, NVA, ANVA, FANVA and GFANVA) of
  our recently identified Cu(II) specific peptide "HGFANVA" were displayed on filamentous
  fd phages. Wild type fd-tet and engineered virus variants were treated with 100
  mM Cu(II) solution at a final phage concentration of 1011 vir/ml and 1012 vir/ml.
  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging before
  Cu(II) exposure showed » 6-8 nm thick filamentous virus layer formation. Cu(II)
